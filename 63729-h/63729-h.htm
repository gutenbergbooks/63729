<div><h1><a id='acc'></a>I<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='sc'>A Country Child</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> is one thing, at least, in this puzzling
world which, though everything changes it,
nothing can spoil: and that is out-of-doors.
Long ago, when this place was stately old
Cedarhurst instead of home-y Bird Corners,
and I a wilful small girl climbing trees and
tearing my frocks whenever Great-aunt Virginia
and Great-aunt Letitia were both looking
the other way at the same time—a coincidence
as blissful as it was infrequent—I
thought being outdoors was heaven enough for
anybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the long winter afternoons I sat by the
big wood fire in the back parlor and hemmed
towels and napkins—when I wasn’t pulling
out yesterday’s work because Great-aunt Virginia
found the stitches too big: and I looked
out at the cold, bare hills, blue and beautiful
against the pale sky, and longed to play over
them like the winds, and to be whirled up into
the air like the brown leaves which scurried
about them all winter long. And in the spring,
when the budding branches draped the trees
with jewelled mists, all silver and green and
gold and ruby-red, I wished the great-aunts
had learned to play on the grass with their
whole selves, instead of just with their fingers
on the big old rosewood piano, which stood
stiff and square in the front parlor, an instrument
of torture to rebellious hands that longed
to be pulling wild-flowers, and to ears tuned to
catch the songs of birds. And in summer time,
when the rain blotted out the hills, and every
leaf of every tree sang the Song of the Rushing
Winds; when the lightning ran zig-zag all
over the sky and the thunder jarred the house—oh,
why should great-aunts call one indoors,
and shut the free winds out, and put cotton
in their ears, and make little girls come away
from the windows, and the chimneys, and
every place where they wanted to be, instead
of leaving them out in the rain to be drenched
like the flowers and shake themselves dry like
the birds?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in autumn—but those memories are
too painful! On frosty days the house was
shut tight, the log fires kindled, and my small
person swathed in insufferable flannels—flannels!—in
a Tennessee October! And when I
rebelled, there were fearsome tales of children
who had died of pneumonia, or gone into consumption,
because their misguided relatives had
allowed them to play outdoors in the cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet outdoors was never more beautiful.
Some of the hills were far and blue, and some
were near and green, or brown with stubble,
or yellow with stalks of corn. The grass in
the pasture was greenest green; and when I
slipped out on the back porch the sycamores
down by the brook rustled their drying leaves
and called me as loud as they dared. And
the doves flew by in flocks, and the killdeers
whirred up from the valley with wild, free
cries, and the field-larks sang on the fence-posts,
or lighted on the short, sweet grass, the
white of their outer tail feathers shining in
the sun. But Great-aunt Letitia would call
me back to the parlor, where she made tea,
which she and Great-aunt Virginia drank,
sitting in rosewood arm-chairs, dressed in soft
shimmering silks, with cobwebby lace about
their throats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I myself balanced unhappily upon one of
the big square ottomans, too small to get far
enough back on it to have any purchase against
the slippery horsehair, and painfully conscious
of Great-aunt Virginia’s eyes on my awkwardly
swinging feet. I kept my place as best I
could, holding a bit of egg-shell china, and
sipping my odious cambric tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the chosen time to instill proper
principles of conduct into my callous little
soul. The gentle old aunts made a duet of it,
and I always thought they practiced it together
beforehand, like a “piece” on the piano.
It was really very easy not to hear!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I always sat on the ottoman nearest the
center table. The other was nearer the east
window, and showed the long front drive bordered
by the stiff lines of cedars, which gave
Cedarhurst its name before the great-aunts
were born. But the one by the table had the
double advantage of giving me a dutiful appearance,
being equally distant from both of
the arm-chairs, and of allowing me, by an
almost imperceptible sliding to one corner, to
look out of the silver-maple window to the jug
of water I kept in the center of the seven
trunks, a drinking fountain for all the birds of
the place. I sat very still during the duet, my
head raised a little to see the lowest branches,
where the birds always alighted; and I often
quite forgot my cambric tea until Great-aunt
Letitia gently reminded me of it. My docility
touched them very much. I heard Great-aunt
Letitia tell Great-aunt Virginia one day that
she was afraid I would never live to grow up,
my expression was so rapt when they urged my
duty upon me; and she felt as though there
were an invisible halo above my little brown
head. I was running in through the hall when I
heard this, and stopped in breathless amazement.
I had no thought of eavesdropping,
but I saw Great-aunt Virginia wipe her eyes;
and Great-aunt Letitia almost sniffed. I sat
stiller than ever after that, and rolled my eyes
a little; and Great-aunt Letitia sent for the
doctor, who said I needed calico dresses and
mud pies. The great-aunts were shocked at
first, but the doctor was firm. And after that
I played outdoors unless the thermometer was
very unkind and the wind in an especially
dangerous quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are really two of the-most-beautiful-place-in-the-world.
One of them is the real
outdoors; and the other is outdoors in the Land
of Make-Believe. The advantage of the real
outdoors is that its loveliness is ready-made.
One invents nothing; one merely opens eyes
and ears and soul to drink in beauty and joy,
and learns, almost without knowing it, the
most curious and interesting things. The advantage
of Make-Believe is that when things
are as they shouldn’t be, one can instantly
step over into that blessed country and make
them be exactly what they should. No one
ever sees you do it, either, or guesses that you
can make a world in a twinkling, out of dreams.
It has all the charm and mystery of a fairy
ring, or fern seed, or Aladdin’s lamp. One’s
body can perch on a horsehair piano stool,
twisting one’s two little meat legs about its
one fat leg of rosewood, and great-aunts may
be sure you are practising scales most faithfully;
and all the time you are really running
races in the wind with charming, dirty children
who tear their dresses all day long, and never
had their hair in curl-papers in their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that is only the beginning. For one
can learn so well the road to that dear land
that one never forgets it, even in grown-up
days. There is never any sickness in Make-Believe.
One can walk and run there always,
though one’s body lies weak and helpless, or
drags slowly about, year after year, in a world
that is full of pain. One can slip away from
the long, black, sleepless nights into a lovely
world where imagination is the motive power,
and all one needs and all one longs for lie
ready to one’s hand.</p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was the January after I was sixteen that
Cedarhurst burned down. It was a bitter
cold time; and the heaviest snow I had ever
seen turned my familiar world into fairyland
under the winter moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Great-aunt Letitia who found the
fire. She had been looking for it all her life.
One of the most familiar memories of my childhood
is the waking at night to hear a soft
rustle past my open door—the doors were always
left open that we might smell the fire
when we really had one—and to see Great-aunt
Letitia, her white hair tucked away under
a dainty nightcap and the light of her candle
bringing out soft gleams in her flowered silk
dressing gown, as she followed her highbred
nose to the spot where it assured her a fire had
broken out. It used to frighten me at first;
but I grew too accustomed to it even to wake.
So it taxed my credulity to the utmost when,
on that bitter night, she roused me to tell me
with tense white lips that Cedarhurst was in
flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How the fire started, we never knew. It
burst through the floor of the empty guest
room first, and the ceiling of the dining-room
below it. But however it started, it was there;
and there was no one to fight it but two fragile
old ladies, a half-grown girl, and the terrified
Negroes. It was before the days of rural telephones,
and the house was in ruins before any
one in the village knew our need. We carried
the news ourselves when we drove into Chatterton
in the gray dawn, shivering with cold.
We were all fully dressed, of course; the
great-aunts would have perished in the flames
before they would have shocked the stars of
heaven by appearing outdoors in the mildest
disarray. And we saved the family silver, a
portrait or two, great-grandmother’s sewing
table, a few books, and the clothes upon our
backs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the way to the village Great-aunt Virginia
said we had much to be thankful for
in that our lives were spared; but hers, had we
known it, was already lost. She had stood
in the snow after the flames barred all access
to the house, until the roof fell in and her birthplace
was a mass of ruins; and before we had
been a week at the home of her nephew, Cousin
William Wrenn, she had died of pneumonia,
leaving Great-aunt Letitia and me, as she told
us in the parting, alone and unprotected save
for the Father of all, to whom she trusted us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Great-aunt Letitia, whom every one expected
to wither and droop without her sister’s
sheltering care, developed an amazing power
of decision. She seemed crushed at first. But on
the fourth day after Great-aunt Virginia had
been laid to rest in the hillside burial ground
at home, she came into the family sitting room,
looking, in her deep mourning, very tall and
white and frail, and announced that she had
decided not to rebuild Cedarhurst, but to go to
the city to live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could scarcely believe my ears. The city’s
outmost edge was only fifteen miles away, but
even the village of Chatterton, peopled largely
by our own relatives, seemed crowded and
bustling after the wide quiet of the fields at
home. That this frail, retiring old lady should
contemplate a plunge into the vortex of a city
whose inhabitants were numbered by tens of
thousands—really several tens—seemed madness.
But her determination was fixed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This dear child needs the advantages of
city life,” she declared. “I always found the
country exceedingly quiet myself, and-er not
altogether—progressive. But I deferred to Sister
Virginia’s judgment. Now, however—” her
voice trembled a moment, and then went on
quite steadily—“the responsibility is mine, and
I cannot shirk it. I think Lydia should
have city advantages. I shall go there and
devote myself to her education, and prepare
for her entrance into society at the proper
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Argument was of no avail. When I avouched
my preference for the country she said
quietly that I knew nothing of the city yet,
and that every one should try more than one
side of life before making a final choice. She
was very gentle, but Great-aunt Virginia herself
could not have been more inflexible. We
went, to the envy of my cousin, Billy Wrenn,
and to my own silent and passionate grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I grew older, Aunt Letitia grew younger—younger,
that is, in her ideas and in her
desires for me. She cared far more than I
about my clothes, and took a livelier interest
in possible lovers. I understood, beneath this
late blossoming of pleasure in what she called
gay life, the starved aspirations of her own
youth, shut away in the seclusion of her beautiful
home during the many years of her widowed
mother’s invalidism and morbid grieving
for her husband. There were times when her
dead-and-gone girlhood rose to life in her eyes,
and a soft color tinged her delicate cheeks, as
she imagined for me some small social triumph
or admired me in some new dress. I divined
that she was immensely interested in my men
friends, though her shyness in discussing them
was even greater than her interest. I wondered
often if she had a love-story of her own;
but I never knew. My own love-story, when
it came, gave her great happiness; and for
three years after my marriage she lived with
us in great content, and passed out at last in
utter peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My husband is known in our family circle
as the Peon, since he entered into a contract to
work for me without wages for life. He
brought into our home at our marriage his
brother’s orphaned child, David Bird, a little
fellow four years of age, who flatly refused to
call me auntie and dubbed me Mammy Lil.
That was many years ago; and as the time has
passed the Peon and I have realized with deepening
gratitude our debt to the little child who
has given our home its crowning joy. But
for David we would have been childless, growing
old alone; for we owe Caro to David, too.
I have never flattered myself that we could
have captured and held the heart of that tricksey
birdling if David had not added to our
attractions childhood’s lure to a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For our years in the city, however, we found
David sufficient in himself. He has grown up
like the Peon’s own son, sturdy, steady, large
of body and of heart. He has stood well in his
classes without much effort; but more because
it is his disposition to do thoroughly whatever
he does at all than because of any great love
for books. He is deliberate in manner, and
somewhat slow of speech; and his steady gray
eyes seem made to look facts in the face. He
has always moved in straight lines, mentally
and physically, cutting through obstacles which
Caro would flutter around in a twinkling; yet
somehow he arrived at the goal in time to
secure whatever he set out to obtain. He was
rather too solemn as a child, and regarded me,
apparently, somewhat as the Peon did at times,
with an air of amused and affectionate tolerance.
I used to hunt through his small personality
for the spark of fun I was sure lay
hidden there, and as the years passed I caught
the glint of it more and more frequently; but
it was really Caro who brought it out into the
open, and set it, a perpetual signal, in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found it easy to awaken in him my own
love of outdoors, and together we made friends
with such birds as could be enticed to our
shady yard in the city’s outer circle. We were
sworn comrades in our enmity to the English
sparrows, and the bond of a common foe was
one of the many things that drew us into a
fellowship unusually close. The Peon used
to say that no boy came to genuine manhood
without something in the way of an evil to
hate and to fight; and for my part I joyfully
set up the English sparrows as the embodiment
of all wickedness, to be destroyed beak and
tail. My own objections to them were the
result of long watching; but David’s hatred
sprang to life full-fledged the morning we
found four of the wretched bullies fighting one
small chickadee, which hung head downward
from a twig of privet, his eyes shut tight, his
claws clenched, and his throat and breast exposed
to his enemies’ vicious bills. I think some
deep thirst for justice seized the child’s soul
at sight of the helpless victim, and ever since
he has been mindful of weak things in a way
surprising in a boy so ruggedly strong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has been wonderfully mindful of me,
always. Long before we left the city I had
learned to enjoy outdoors from a cot under
the trees in the back yard. The pain which
was to be by turns my companion, my jailer,
and my emancipator had already laid upon
me an iron hand. I was up and about when
the Peon was at home; but when he came in
unexpectedly he learned to look for me under
the drooping silver maples in the yard; and my
old-time love of birds was an easy explanation
of the many-cushioned cot and the long hours
I daily spent upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David filled the birds’ drinking fountain
for me when he came home to leave his books
and get his bat or his football; and I would lie
there, watching my visitors, wondering at the
variety of birds to be seen in a city yard, and
wishing the sparrows’ duels were less on the
harmless French order. They never fought
because they needed to do it; it was always for
something perfectly futile and foolish. They
would leave all the food I could scatter to tear
one crumb from a neighbor. For it is English sparrow
nature never to be satisfied with what
they have, to want only what some one else is
enjoying, and to get it for themselves if they
can. David and I were fully agreed that if anything
more hateful was ever created we wished
to be spared acquaintance with it.</p>

<div><h1><a id='birdc'></a>II<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='sc'>Bird Corners</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is to Uncle Milton that I owe our return
to the country, and all the delights of Bird
Corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Milton is an inheritance from my
great-aunts and Cedarhurst, where he had the
finest flowers and the most flourishing vegetable
garden in the country. He is a lean old
Negro, tall, and straight as a pine. His features
are finely cut; and with his gray hair,
long gray moustache, regular features, and
skin like polished bronze, he makes a distinguished
appearance, even in his old blue jeans.
He is a real lover of the outdoor world, and
the earth and the plants know it. He bends
over the flower-beds lovingly, with eyes that
see, not dirt, but all dirt’s possibilities of beauty
and life. There is never a plant set carelessly
nor a seed that falls by chance. No wonder
all he touches grows!</p>

<p class='pindent'>That he went to town with Great-aunt Letitia,
and stayed there afterward with me, spoke
eloquently of the strength of affection between
us. But after my great-aunt’s death he did not
accept the situation without constant protests,
and the advice which my youth and ignorance
demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ain’t got no mo’ business in de city dan
I is, Miss Lil,” he said spring after spring, as I
sat on the grass by the flower-beds and watched
his fork go in and out like clock-work, leaving
behind it long rows of fresh-turned earth.
“You done los’ all dem roses you had in yo’
face at home. Ef Miss Ferginny done lived
she wouldn’ put up wid dis foolishness not er
minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the city is more convenient for Mr.
Bird,” I would explain. “Some day when he
is rich enough he expects to give up business,
and then we will go back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be givin’ up his wife fus’ news you
know,” growled the old man, stopping to thin
the thick border of violets. “An’ he’ll be goin’
to bury you dar by Miss Ferginny and Miss
’Titia befo’ he goes retirin’ from business ef he
don’ look out. We-all got er plenty ter live on
now—you got er plenty widout his’n; en ef you
ain’t, I kin make er plenty outen dat groun’.
Hit’s de riches’ lan’ in Davis’son county. I
made hit pay befo’, en I kin do hit agin, stidder
was’in’ it on po’ white-trash renters like you all
do. But I ’clare to gracious, Miss Lil, ef you-all
don’ go, I will. I been mixin’ up wid town
niggers till I’m plumb wo’ out wid ’em. Dis
is de las’ spring Milton’ll fix yo’ flowers in dis
mizzable little cramped-up lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had said this so often that I regarded it
as one of Nature’s regular spring processes;
and beyond a sudden deeper stirring of my
constant homesickness, his threats passed unnoticed.
But one February morning he came out
and stood by my cot under the trees with a
face at once elated and downcast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to begin the spring work today?”
I asked in delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked embarrassed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hit’s sorter early to rake dem leaves offen
de beds yit,” he said. Then he hesitated. “I
’spec I ain’t gwinter be able ter do de wuk
no mo’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sick?” I asked anxiously. Then I
saw the new look in his face, and gasped.
“You’re going to the country!” I cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yassum, I is. I can’t stan’ it yere no
longer, Miss Lil: I’m er gittin’ too ole fer
town; I des bleeged ter go out whar God made
de worl’ en breathe free en be er man ergin,
befo’ I die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The years had slipped from him like a cloak.
I looked at him enviously—just as an English
sparrow might look at some bird of stronger
flight, I reflected suddenly, and scowled at one
of my greedy kinsman in the walk, trying to
gobble all the best crumbs at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad for you,” I said honestly. “When
do you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When my mont’s out. But I hates ter go,
Miss Lil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I to do here?” I demanded, the
sparrow in me refusing to be quenched altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do de bes’ I kin,” he said. “I been
lookin’ roun’ fer you all winter. But dese
town niggers is a onery set, fer sho’. When
you-all comes home Milton’s comin’ back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind,” I said; “we’ll manage somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I closed my eyes because they were getting
full of tears. He moved away, and I let the
tears come. I wanted the country, too; and
more and more as my illness grew, and it became
increasingly difficult to take my part in
the busy city life. The more one’s bodily freedom
is restricted by weakness and pain, the
more one longs for the unconfined spaces of
earth and air, for wide horizons and sweeping
winds, and wings that flash far up into the sunshine,
above the shadows where one must lie,
conning the hard lesson of patient idleness.
And I wanted Uncle Milton—the visible link
between me and that dear world of hill and sky
for which I longed. Return to it seemed so
bright a possibility while another heart, even
this old Negro’s, held it as dear as I. If he
went from me he would leave my hope bereft.
I lay with closed eyes, absorbed in longing for
that dear receding vision of delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’ you see how bad she wanter go, Marse
John?” said Uncle Milton again, close beside
me. I sprang up in amazement, to find him
and the Peon by my cot. “She ain’t gwine ter
say a word ef she think hit’ll discommerdate
you; but de chile’s e’en erbout breakin’ her
heart fer de country, same as I is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Milton,” I began indignantly; but
the old man brushed my words aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You en Marse John fight hit out, honey,”
he said. “Mek ’er tell de trufe, Marse John.
Hit’s you en her fer it now; Milton’s done
his bes’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned deliberately and walked out of
the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not take the Peon long to get the
facts, to answer all my objections as to the inconvenience
to himself, and to settle finally our
immediate return. We would rebuild Cedarhurst
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” I cried, “not Cedarhurst! Let us
build our own home, all sunshine and out-of-doors!
It isn’t the old house that I love;
it was too cold and stately and dark—such an
indoors kind of house. It’s the hills I’m homesick
for, and the sky, and the biggest maple,
and the pasture, and the sycamores down by
the brook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we can’t sleep in the maple,” objected
the Peon, “nor eat in the pasture when it rains.
There must be a house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course. But let it be our house—not
Great-aunt Virginia’s. You may really
build it any way you please if only you will
have porches enough, and so many windows
that wherever you sit you can lift your eyes
and look right out, miles and miles and miles.
And I’d like all the rooms to have a southern
exposure, of course, on account of the breeze
and the sun, and east windows for winter mornings,
and west windows for the sunsets. I
don’t care about the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I insist upon bath-rooms and a kitchen,”
said the Peon; “mere scenery is not a sufficient
sanitary basis for life. But what shall we call
it—Cedarhurst?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no! Just a plain, every day, home-y
name—something that belongs to us and the
birds. Why, we’re Birds ourselves, Peon,
dear. Let’s be sociable and call it Bird Corners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there aren’t any corners,” said the
practical Peon; “the place lies straight along
the pike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is a man’s way. He thinks he must
face facts and shape his course accordingly,
poor slave to the visible that he is. But a woman
conquers facts by turning her back upon
them, and playing they are something else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The birds will make the corners,” I explained
patiently. “Before I’ve been putting
out crumbs a month there’ll be bird pikes cutting
through the place at every conceivable
angle, and crossing each other under that seven-trunked
maple where my cot will be. And if
that won’t be bird corners, what will?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So we prepared for our homing flight. Uncle
Milton went out at once to trim the trees and
prune the shrubbery and vines; and the occasional
days he bestowed on us in town were
full of delight for me, filled as they were with
reports of progress at home. For it was home,
before dirt had been broken for the house; the
city dwelling was a mere temporary shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De jonquils out home is showin’ up fine,”
he announced one morning in mid-February;
“hit’s time to sorter stir up dese yere lazy town
flowers. En I’ll trim de trees, too, seein’ I’m
’bout done wid ’em out home. I ’spec de city
folks what’ll live yere atter we-all gone’ll want
what little dab er trees dey got in dis yard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked scornfully at the back yard, generous
in size, after the fashion of our Southern
cities, and shaded with fine old trees. But a
little later, high in the hackberry, his love of all
earth-rooted things swept contempt from his
heart, and his dark old face shone with happiness
as he wielded the hatchet with rhythmic
strokes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is always the beginning of the spring
work—the severance of death from life, that
life may rise again, even out of death. Where
would life draw this dead matter next? To
darkness first, to growth most surely, and perchance,
some day, to wings. And the dark old
man with the happy face was servitor of life—life
for the dead as for the living; for death is
but the underside of life.</p>

<hr class='tbk101'/>

<p class='pindent'>We went home early in May. The house
would not be finished until October; but outdoors
was all ready for us, and we could not
waste the summer for lack of a house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” I argued to the Peon, “we
had a beautiful time in the mountains last summer;
and we slept in a two-roomed cottage with
only weather-boarding between us and the
trees outside. Why can’t we have a shed with
a gasoline stove, and a couple of tents to live
in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So we had them. The Peon and David drove
in to Chatterton daily and took the train for
business and school; and I fed the birds and
followed Uncle Milton, and drank in the
changing beauties of earth and sky. And all
summer we watched our home grow, from cellar
to roof-tree, till it became a thing complete,
and fitted into the landscape for which
it was designed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We set it on the old home’s hill, which overlooked
the countryside, and faced it toward
the sunrising. The dark lines of cedars which
had bordered the approach to the old house
were left at one side, and the road, curving
from their upper end, swept into full sunshine
and passed under a great beech, which spread
its tiers of leaves above the doorway. It is an
unpretentious house, rambling about pretty
much as it pleases in its efforts to give southern
and eastern and western exposures to all
the rooms. Porches are everywhere, and the
windows either open on them, like doors, or
stop a little above the floor at low, cushioned
seats, which tempt one to sink down and wonder
once again at the beauty of this fair country
of middle Tennessee. There are no curtains
at the windows, nor mats of vines outside.
But up the widely-separated columns of the
porches run clematis and jasmines which cross
the great openings in narrow bands, above
and below. So all summer the fretwork of
green leaves frames the landscape, a perfect,
yet everchanging picture in each of the wide
spaces. The east end of the living-room is of
glass, and my flowers flourish there in winter
time. In my own room the bed stands in a
deep recess formed all of windows on the three
sides. A low seat runs under them within
reach of the bed. All through the dark, sleepless
night I can lie there and watch for the
first paling of the eastern sky, and follow the
level light as it moves softly along the southern
hills, creating the shadows which make the light
so clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be confessed that some of the kin at
Chatterton thought my wits astray that first
summer, and the Peon but a soft-headed, poor-spirited
creature for giving way to my whimsies.
Camping out was not as popular then as
it is now; and the older members of the family
did not hesitate to commiserate the Peon and
David. That they professed to enjoy our long
picnic only added to the heinousness of my
folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cousin Chadwell Grackle and his wife were
among my first callers. Cousin Chad is always
to the front when anything new crops up in the
family. He has cried the sins and shortcomings
of the whole usual order so long that even
he is half bored with them, and the prospect of
something new to criticise whets his social appetite
to the keenest possible edge. Cousin
Jane is his reflection and echo. If she were
not, even her stolid nerves could scarcely have
endured his painful type of piety without disaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drove up one sunshiny morning, after
they had seen the Peon and David pass on
their way to town. I was on the cot under the
biggest maple. Its seven trunks fall apart
like long-stemmed flowers in a vase, spreading
into a great green tent whose leafy curtains
droop in a circle full seventy feet across.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blackbirds were my principal guests
that morning, a sanctimonious crew in sleek
black coats, solemn, censorious, and self-satisfied
to the last degree. All birds which walk
instead of hopping are awkward-looking; but
none are as preposterous as the blackbirds, because
none of them put on such sanctified airs.
As they moved about this morning, their heads
thrust meekly forward, ducking modestly as
they stepped, they appeared to be meditating
on their neighbors’ sins. But they had their
tribe’s keen eye for the main chance, and it
was a swift bird and a wary one which secured
a big crumb with these feathered Chadbands
in the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked up at the sound of wheels and nearly
choked with swallowing my laughter. Cousin
Chad and Cousin Jane did look so sleek and
proper, that as I rose to meet them I could not
refrain from throwing some extra crumbs on
the grass for possible additions to my breakfasting
guests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They descended ponderously and looked at
me with the apprehensive scrutiny one might
bestow on a lunatic who is liable to break out
immediately in a fresh place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Lyddy?” inquired Cousin
Jane, with sepulchral anxiety. Cousin Chad,
busy with the hitching-post, listened with his
back as well as with his ears. They both know
perfectly that I have always been Lil to everyone
except the great-aunts, and that Lyddy
has been an abomination to the entire family
connection, and especially to me, since they
first invented it in my childhood. That is why
they stick to it. They believe in chastenings, do
my cousins, the Grackles—particularly when
they are the chasteners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m perfectly well,” I answered, with added
emphasis to my usual formula. “Come
and sit down. There’s no need to ask how you
and Cousin Chad are; you look the picture of
health.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Appearances don’t do to go by, Lyddy,”
she answered solemnly, sinking ponderously
on a creaking campstool. “Chadwell’s been
havin’ sciatica, and I’ve stayed awake nights
with him till I’m just about worn out. But
I’ve never made my afflictions an excuse for
shirkin’ my duty. We came over to say that
as you seem to be without a roof over your
heads we’d take you to board till your house is
finished—if it ever is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced contemptuously at the amorphous
piles of building material just beyond
us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can have the second spare bed-room
upstairs,” put in Cousin Chad. “It’s more to
my interest to put you in the front one; but
livin’ comes high any way you take it, and I
want to consider you. I reckon John ain’t able
to spend much, with all this building on hand.
The back room’s small, but you three can make
out in it. If you want the other, of course it
will cost more. You can come over this evening
after John gets home, and he and I can
settle the terms after supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I kept my face quite straight, and made a
handsome contribution to current fiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s so kind of you. John will appreciate
it as much as I. But we really enjoy camping,
and would not give it up even for those lovely
rooms of yours, Cousin Chad. Thank you so
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cousin Jane’s rubicund complexion assumed
a purplish hue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you intend to kill that delicate child of
Henry Bird’s, making him sleep out in the
weather all summer?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I said, considering; “I don’t intend
to kill him, exactly. And he isn’t at all delicate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he will be by the time you get
through with him—if he ain’t dead,” broke in
Cousin Chad. “Lyddy, it’s my duty to speak
plainly, and I’ll not shirk it. Letitia spoiled
you from the time you were born, and John
Bird seems bent on keeping it up. David will
pay the penalty for it. We do a very different
part by the orphan the Lord made it our duty
to take charge of, I can assure you. Caroline
Wrenn’s health is taken care of, with a view
to her future usefulness as a Christian. But
of course you’ll stick to your own ways.—Well,
I’ve warned you: my conscience is clear. Come,
Jane: we’d better be going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad your conscience is clear, Cousin
Chad. I know that’s a comfort to you, if I’m
not. But we can be good friends, can’t we,
even though our ideas are different?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not turn my back upon you if
you’re in trouble, Lyddy, if that’s what you
mean,” he answered. “I hope I know my
duty better than that. But when you want
help again you must ask for it. I don’t intend
to offer it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a bargain, then,” I said; “and we
must both remember it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cousin Jane looked at me sharply, but Cousin
Chad was already heaving her into the buggy,
and she turned to get a good grip on the
side. The vehicle creaked as she settled in it,
and groaned when Cousin Chad sank beside
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Lyddy,” she said. “We’ve
done our best. I hope you won’t regret it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This quite upset me, and after the cedars
hid them I lay laughing until the thought of
poor little Caro suddenly sobered me. What
were they doing to Billy’s child? I must
make friends with Cousin Jane, somehow, and
entice the little thing over to Bird Corners as
much as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no one else whom our erratic manner
of life really scandalized, except Cousin
Jason Blue; and he, as he took occasion to
tell me when he met me out driving one day
with Caro, never made a fool of himself like
Chad Grackle by meddling. If a woman
wanted to follow her nature and behave like
a lunatic, and her husband chose to allow it,
it was none of his business; so he shrugged
his shoulders and passed on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cousin Jason and the Grackles are the only
kin I have in all Chatterton whose kinship I
would discount if I could; but there is no denying
they belong in the family. Cousin Chad’s
father was my grandmother’s third half-cousin
on my father’s side; and Cousin Jason’s mother
was Cousin Lysander Hilliard’s step-daughter
by his second marriage: there could
scarcely be anything plainer than that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if Cousin Jason had his drawbacks,
there are none about his half-sister, Grace, fifteen
years his junior, and, except Ella, the
dearest friend I have. She married George
Wood soon after I married the Peon, and
they have a daughter, Milly, about the age of
Caro Wrenn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David took kindly to country life, and to
his numerous cousins-by-marriage. There
were plenty of boys among them; and though
at first they resented David’s city ways, their
respect for him grew immensely when they
found how far he could bat a ball; and after
he had whipped Bob White in single combat
he was admitted to Chatterton boydom as a
comrade in full fellowship. There was no
particular reason for his fighting Bob, so far
as we dull grown-ups could discover, except
that Bob was the leader of his set, and a fight
was considered the necessary initiation to membership.
As soon as this was made clear to
him, David had painstakingly trodden on Bob’s
toes, and the preliminaries were arranged at
once. The boys were excellent friends, before
and afterward; and the Peon would not allow
me to discuss the matter with David. They
talked it out in private, and reached some
amicable male conclusion of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the girl cousins David was loftily tolerant,
excepting Caro Wrenn. She was five
years old the spring we came back to the
country, when David was half-past nine. Her
mother had died when she was born, and her
father, Billy Wrenn, had gone to Colorado
three years afterward, to die there of consumption.
He made Cousin Chad Caro’s
guardian before he died, knowing, as we all
did, Cousin Chad’s remarkable ability in reaping
financial harvests from even the smallest
investments; but he left the child herself with
her mother’s sister, Sally Martin, never dreaming
that death would again bereave the little
creature of a mother’s love. Sally died, quite
suddenly, less than a year after Billy; and
Cousin Chad and Cousin Jane, intent, as usual,
on doing their impeccable duty, assumed sole
care of the little heiress, and installed her in
their own childless and virtuous home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A more incongruous setting for her could
scarcely have been found. She was a tiny creature,
with rose-leaf skin, great hazel eyes, a
mop of red-brown curls, and a mouth where
laughter bubbled all day long. Quick and bird-like
in all her movements, she flitted in and
out of the most unexpected recesses in the
twinkling of an eye, with endless flutterings of
hands and skirts and sweet gurglings of suppressed
laughter. Almost from her cradle she
sang—queer little soft croonings which slipped
into tunes before she could speak their words.
Cousin Jane scarcely knew what to make of
her, and was torn between a sincere desire to do
her Spartanly-Christian duty by her, and her
solemn puzzlement over what she considered
the child’s combination of depravity and charm.
Even Cousin Jane could not be very severe
with her; but she had an uneasy sense of spoiling
her every time she forebore the rod, so that
I found her more than willing to turn the child
over to me for the greater part of the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This arrangement gave my revered relative
ample warrant for looking closely into my
household affairs and reproving me for everything
she did and didn’t discover; it was her
duty to know all about a place where dear
Caroline spent so much of her time. And when
Caro departed from Cousin Jane’s ideals, as
she did with every movement of body and
mind, it was a great relief to my pious cousin to
be able publicly to disavow all responsibility
for the child’s shortcomings. What, as she
constantly inquired, could one expect of Caroline
when that scatter-brained Lyddy would
persist in encouraging the child in her flightiness?
She published abroad her own powerlessness
to control either Caro or the situation,
and openly washed her hands of the consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro and I bore up as best we could, and the
Peon and David stood by us nobly. David,
indeed, was ready to fight his idol’s battles with
Cousin Jane herself. In fact, he grew up with
a lack of respect for that excellent lady which
tempted her to assume the role of a prophet,
in which capacity she dwelt at large on the
penitentiary as David’s ultimate place of residence.
Caro always responded to these prognostications
that, if Davy went to the penimtentium,
she would go, too, as soon as she was
big enough, and keep house for him, and make
the cook give them ice-cream every day that
came. And so the matter rested.</p>

<div><h1><a id='inmake'></a>III<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='sc'>In Make-Believe</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is four years since I wrote those last
words. Not long after, Caro went away to
school. David went North to college that year,
and was only coming home for the regular
holidays. He still held to his boyhood preference,
and was determined to be a scientific
farmer: and since the Peon and I were to have
him with us always, we wanted him to have a
few years quite away from us in which to make
his own adjustments to life. So they left us
the same week, David with all a boy’s love to
hold him back, and a young man’s eagerness to
urge him away; and Caro in as nearly easterly
weather as her sunny nature ever experienced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Cousin Jane who first decided on
Caro’s banishment. For the sake of her own
peace of mind she had of late years resigned
the child almost entirely to me; but every now
and then she had what Caro called a “qualm
spell.” During these painful periods Caro resided
with the Grackles, strictly, not even coming
over to take lunch with me. She arose at
five and extinguished her light at nine; and
pinned on the wall beside her bureau, in Cousin
Jane’s firm handwriting, was a schedule of useful
occupations for each of the intervening sixteen
hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had so much time for devotions, so much
for meals, so much for school, for study, for
“domestic occupations,” for “improving and
useful reading,” and for “practical sewing.”
Cousin Jane never allowed precious time
wasted on fancy work; and if she thought it
was all like the awful things she had in her
parlor I don’t in the least blame her for thinking
it wicked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Caro’s time was laid out for her
as exactly as the squares on a checker-board.
She fed the chickens, argued with the old biddies
who wanted to “set” in the wrong place,
and wheedled the arrogant old Buff Orpington,
who ruled the hens and Cousin Jane with
ease and contempt, into doing whatever she
wanted of him. She made butter that drew
near-smiles to Cousin Jane’s stiff lips, and
evolved cakes that called forth lectures to
Cousin Chad on the sin of gluttony. She
sewed, without a murmur, or a particle of trimming,
undergarments of good, reliable, ever-wearing
domestic. She was always foresighted
enough to make ample allowance for
their shrinking when washed; whereby she both
pleased Cousin Jane and insured an excellent
fit for little black Josie when she returned to
us with a halo of virtue above her red-brown
curls. She read history till she could put me
to the blush. She washed the best tea-cups and
the Persian cat. She dusted the parlor daily.
And from her early childhood she made irreproachable
jam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It really was excellent training for her;
thorough good discipline, as Cousin Jane would
say; especially as it was interspersed with
“spells of Bird-Cornering,” during which she
sojourned with the Peon and me. For the
period of discipline always followed an accustomed
round. It began with a Cousin Jane all
severity, lynx-eyed to drag poor Caro’s delinquencies
to light and overcome them by unsparing
criticism. But Caro has always made
play of everything, finding by the talisman of
her own happy heart the hidden beauty, or
laughter, of the ugliest and solemnest things.
She did all Cousin Jane found for her to
do—which is saying a good deal—not only
cheerfully, but with whole-souled delight, as if
it were her very meat and drink. Doing it
that way, she did it beyond criticism; and
Cousin Jane would begin to relax, unwillingly,
unable to find a flaw, yet with an uneasy feeling
that something must be wrong, or Caro
couldn’t possibly be enjoying herself so much.
When she set herself to mortify Caro’s girlish
vanity the child met her more than half-way.
She did her best to “slick” her curls, and donned
shapeless gingham aprons as joyously as
though they were made of jewels and lace.
Cousin Jane would find herself being mollified
to the point of indulgence in spite of herself;
and about that time Caro would come flying
into the yard at Bird Corners and drop
fluttering beside me, her eyes shining with the
pure joy of living and the love of living things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m back again, Mammy Lil,” she would
laugh, whirling about on one toe. “Cousin
Jane hasn’t scolded me for four days, and yesterday
she almost patted my head; so I knew
she thought I’d had training enough for the
present, and I’d be coming back home in a jiffy.
They’re so good to me in their funny way I’m
most ashamed to be glad to come home to you—but
I am, all the same. Where’s Josie? I’ve
made three new petticoats and a night gown
for her, out of muslin strong enough to climb
trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth was that when Caro came back to
me it was because Cousin Jane had detected in
her own soul symptoms of the child’s being
made an idol: she had to get rid of her to recover
her own moral poise. But she still intended
to do her full duty by her: so when Caro
was fifteen she was sent to boarding school,
to remain at least five years. By that time
Cousin Jane hoped to have re-established her
own imperturbability without unduly exposing
her charge to the dangerous influences of Bird
Corners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had a battle royal concerning the school
she should go to, and to this day Cousin Jane
thinks she won. She really has no more idea
about schools than a chinquapin worm, living
fat and contented in its own sufficient little
world; and I knew she’d be for sending the
child to some fifth-rate country “college”
where she’d be taught poor music and worse
French, and be worked to death learning things
the way they aren’t. So I wrote, ostentatiously,
for the catalogue of one of the most exclusive,
nonsensical, and extravagant “finishing
schools”; and privately ordered sent to
Cousin Jane one from the school I wished Caro
to attend. It was a sensible place where she’d
be taken care of, and given a chance to grow
up to the best of herself in body and mind. I
plead for the finishing school, and sniffed diligently
at the other, even advocating the
dreaded “college” as preferable; whereby I
had the comfort of having Caro sent where I
wanted her, with Cousin Jane’s mind so
definitely set on keeping her there that I
knew her education was provided for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro rebelled against going. For the first
time in her life she did not want to please us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not well enough to do without me
and David, too, Mammy Lil,” she insisted;
“it’s just a pretense that you don’t need me;
and I don’t care whether I’m educated or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She yielded to the inevitable between tears
and laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyway,” she reflected, “there’s Make-Believe
left: you’ll never get rid of me there,
will you? I’ll come there every day of the
world, and David, too: and ten times a day if
you want me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a genuine relief to have her go; it was
becoming most difficult to blind her bright
eyes to my illness. It was much simpler to
keep up appearances with the Peon, who left
home early and returned late, and who was
often called away for days together. If I
sat up as usual when he was in the house it
was becoming necessary to lie quite still all
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For weeks after the children left I enjoyed
being alone, and the freedom from effort which
it brought. But as the winter wore on, the loneliness
proved a lure to introspection and self-pity—those
quicksands of despair which encircle
the country of enforced idleness; and as
I lay under my windows or beneath the trees
I began, for pleasure and companionship, to
write the story of our happy life and of the
children’s growing up. But the note-book
proved desperately heavy, and the few pages
I filled took weeks instead of days; until at last
I ceased the effort until I should be stronger,
as I had ceased so many other things in this
journeying into the Land of Idleness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made a new acquaintance that winter—a
wretched little blue devil to whom I gave the
name of Grumpy, and with whom I battled
from morning till night, and especially from
night till morning. It is not pain that blue
devils thrive on—I had proved that all these
many years; it is idleness that gives them their
chance for mischief—the helpless idleness of utter
exhaustion, when one’s thoughts hang vacant,
and body nor mind can longer force its
way past the wall of pain to move, however
slowly, in the beautiful outside world of human
effort and achievement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Grumpy came to Bird Corners. Satan
himself knows no self-respecting devil would
have stayed on the premises after the way I
treated the creature; but blue devils respect
neither themselves nor anybody else. An hour
after I had flung him out by the heels he would
bob up by the sofa in the finest fettle imaginable,
grinning at my exhaustion from our late
encounter. The most I ever could be sure of
doing was keeping him invisible to every one
else; but he made up for that in the nights.
Still, one adjusts one’s self to the inevitable in
time; and blue devils are all in the day’s work,
I suppose, like the dentist or a cold in one’s
head. One gets through with the visitation
somehow, and laughs afterward because, for
the time, at least, it is over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the children came home in the summer
there was trouble, of course. Doctors
came and went, though I had privately done
my full duty by them long before; and I
swallowed a deal of nasty stuff which did absolutely
no good, except that it soothed the feelings
of the family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the end of the summer David was insisting
on something radical; and when he went
back to college he took me with him, and deposited
me in a northern sanitarium, where I
was to lie flat on my back three months, and
be made over as good as new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not only radical, but revolutionary.
Chatterton had never before furnished an inmate
for a sanitarium. The word, indeed, was
commonly understood as a polite euphemism
for a lunatic asylum. The sentiments of the
kin ranged all the way from Grace Wood’s
anxious hopefulness to Cousin Jane’s frank
curiosity concerning what new kind of craziness
Lyddy had been up to now, to make John
Bird feel like she had to be shut up in a private
mad-house. She took my part, however, so
far as to say, both to my face and behind my
back, that I wasn’t a mite crazier than I’d
been all my life; and if folks could get along
with me this long it did look like a pity they
couldn’t put up with me a while longer, and
save disgracing the family. There was nothing
the matter with me, Cousin Jane opined, beyond
being spoiled to death, and lazy; and,
anyway, it was flying in the face of Providence
to go on living if your time had come
to die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to going North, she never did believe in
wasting money on conceited Yankee doctors
when there were so many struggling physicians
at home, to say nothing of the heathen in
foreign lands who were dropping into hell-fire
so many a minute for lack of any kind of doctors,
good or bad, to keep them alive until
the missionaries could get to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s no use preachin’ to selfish ears,”
she concluded, drawing her heavy silk wrap
about her ample shoulders and settling her bonnet
strings. “I’ve been wastin’ my breath, of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed a pity that she should, whether
from my point of view or her own; so I smiled
as sympathetically as I could, and offered my
cheek for her farewell salute. She bestowed it
impressively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, good-bye, Lyddy. I suppose I won’t
see you again in this life; an’ in the other one
failin’ wits won’t trouble us, I trust. I want
you to know I don’t hold any of your foolishness
against you, child: I reckon you never did
have sense like the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went out with her ponderous, firm tread,
and Caro flitted to my side, her head thrown
up, ruffling like an angry wren.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mammy Lil, its a shame you made me
promise to be good! Do let me run after her
and——” She caught my eye and broke into
bubbling laughter, dropping her head on my
pillows and snuggling her little nose under my
chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it’s funny,” she admitted presently;
“and if you will laugh, I have to. But
I can’t see how she can be so wooden-headed
and yet be alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She isn’t alive very much, poor soul!” I
answered, soberly enough. “I don’t think
anybody really lives except so far as they understand
life—and people. When you think
of it in that way, Cousin Jane has lived in a
closer confinement all her life than I’ll be when
I get to the asylum.”</p>

<hr class='tbk102'/>

<p class='pindent'>That was three years ago, and more, and I
am here at the sanitarium yet, though the Peon
is coming to take me home next month. It was
I who set the limit of my stay at three months,
when I came; I was determined to be well by
that time. I even had Caro put my note-book
in my trunk, because I expected to fill it before
I came back. That is why I am writing this
chapter, a few lines at a time, on good days:
I am determined to do something that I planned
doing, before I go back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would take more note-books than my
trunk could hold to tell the story of the kindness
shown me here; of the patience, skill, and
resourcefulness which have fought for me when
I could no longer fight for myself. And it
is good to be in a place like this for awhile,
to learn what human nature is capable of under
racking, tearing strain. The courage one
finds, the high-hearted endurance of plain, ordinary
people, the brave good cheer of men
and women whose pain-lined faces choke one’s
throat with tears! I have seen these things
so often these last eighteen months—or at least
in so much of them as I could be carried, lying
flat in a wheeled-chair, out on one of the balconies,
where I could catch glimpses of the
struggles that were going on around me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not all loss, this suffering. Sickness
does bring out hidden ugliness and weakness,
for it searches soul and body to the inmost
core. But there is more good hidden than
there is evil; and in the stress of suffering the
most ordinary people blossom into a loveliness
of soul which reveals them as of the company
of the saints. Life is so narrow and commonplace
to the average experience that it can
only make a narrow and commonplace appeal.
“The trivial round, the common task” has,
for so many, no large connections; and the
depths of their natures are never stirred until
their every-day world lies in ruins about them,
and to live at all they must discover new resources
in</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“—<span class='it'>that true world within the world we see</span>,”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and gain a true perspective and a new horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the funny folk in a place like this—they
would fill volumes, too! Of course they
are pitiful; but I never could see the harm of
laughter over pitifulness, if only one doesn’t
laugh unkindly. For some of them never find
new resources. Disaster leads them, not to
discovery, but to an <span class='it'>impasse</span>; and they revenge
themselves on the inexplicable by endless incongruities
of thought and action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The patient who really helped me most was
a dear old lady who, though forbidden, like
the rest, to talk to me, felt it her heaven-sent
mission to cheer me up. Whenever she saw
me deposited on the porch she flew out, wringing
her hands in sympathy, and exclaiming,
“Oh, <span class='it'>what</span> is life without health!” It really
is a good deal when you come to think of it;
and the old lady’s reiterations elicited a string
of mental replies as long as from western New
York to Bird Corners, and kept me in ammunition
for Grumpy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Grumpy has been at this sanitarium
for three years and seven weeks. But the
Peon has been here, too, and David—and Cousin
Jane! Caro I have not seen in all these
years: Cousin Jane doesn’t consider it decent
for a young girl to be allowed in a place where
women may be seen in the halls in kimonos,
and men are allowed to sit in wheeled-chairs on
the balconies, shamelessly clad in their bath
robes, with heaven knows what garments, or
lack of garments, underneath. Caro should
not set foot in the place; and no entreaties
could move her. But Caro has written, every
week of the world; and, to make up for my
not having her, Cousin Jane paid me a visit
herself. She felt it her duty, she said, to find
out what kind of a place it was that John Bird
had shut Lyddy up in; and if the rest of the
family wouldn’t look after me, she would. So
she came, suspicious and inquisitorial, and
melted visibly under the tactful suavity of the
physician in charge,—“the Head,” as we called
him. She even began to help him, ministering
to the patients after a fashion all her own.
She had it out with one of them, a metaphysical
lady, a very unorthodox person, and left her
in a state of collapse. In no uncertain tones
she expressed her views on hen-pecking to another,
an elderly lady with a liver and a youthful
husband. I don’t know what would have
happened further if I had not been inspired
to beguile her into going down into the treatment
rooms for a Turkish bath. She came up
purple with wrath, and began to pack her
trunk, declaring that she washed her hands of
the place forever; and if I wanted to stay there
and have my morals corrupted, I could; but for
her part she was going back to her own bathtub,
and the religion she was brought up in.
And go she did, that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For myself, these three years must remain
in the silence in which they have been spent.
The pain I wish to forget; today’s pain is
enough. And the helplessness and idleness, so
much worse than the pain—that too, I would
shut from my memory. But the kindness
which has filled these years—that is an eternal
possession. And the loveliness of this little valley
is mine always, cut off as it is in my
thoughts as a place apart from all my real
world and life, shut in and hidden by its beautiful
circling hills. I have called it the Enchanted
Valley, because it seemed sometimes as
if some spell had caught and bound me to it
forever. But now that I am to go free at last
I can forget all that, and remember only the
enchantment of its beauty, and the kindness of
those who dwell in it. The Land of Make-Believe,
too, is as near me as under the trees
at home. I have had beautiful times in Make-Believe,
day and night, and especially at night.
I have seen Caro there, you may be sure! I
made a jingle about it not long ago which tells
the real story of these long years better than
anything else I could write.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now it is mid-November, for the weeks
have passed by as I lay here, writing a bit as
I could; and I am to be home Thanksgiving
morning; not home in Make-Believe, but home
in real Bird Corners, down in Tennessee!
David is there, for good, now, running the
farm as he planned, but helping the Peon in
his office, too; and Caro is coming home for
Christmas, and to stay “forever,” she says, in
June; and I am to get well—some day—at
home. I can walk quite a little already—twenty
yards sometimes; and the bad days
are better than they used to be, and farther
apart. Even Grumpy must admit that good
bad days are encouraging!</p>

<hr class='tbk103'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>All</span> the people you love in Make-Believe?
Not quite all—not Ella. Somehow I can’t look
for her there any more; not since the day the
letter came back unopened. We were together
in Make-Believe always before that. But when
I see her again it will be when Make-Believe
will have disappeared, with the world we see,
and the real world will be plain to sight. But
everybody else was there—even pious, pompous
Cousin Chad, and foolish, kind-hearted,
exasperating Cousin Jane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now it’s day after tomorrow, and the
Peon is coming in four days!</p>

<div><h1><a id='dark'></a>IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='sc'>The Dark O’ the Year</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>November 30th.</span> The deepest joys can
never be put into words; but lying here in my
own dear room, close under the long windows
which form its eastern side, and looking out
across the valley to the familiar hills beyond, I
know there is one spot on the map more beautiful
than anything Make-Believe can show. The
Peon and David left me only an hour ago—the
real ones, I mean; and out on the lawn
Uncle Milton is pretending to rake invisible
leaves, looking towards my windows every
few minutes to assure himself that I am really
here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the wall of honeysuckle along the pasture
fence the cardinal and his wife are flitting
about, just as I left them three years ago; and
in the lilac outside my window, where all the
spring-time beauty sleeps safe in the sheltering
buds, a Carolina wren proclaims the triumph
of days to come. His spring song is a
bubbling rhapsody of present love and delight;
but his winter song is vibrant with the joy of
things unseen. He sings as one who carries
spring in his heart always, as vivid a reality in
December as when all the woods are green. To
doubts, questions and hopes he has one answer,
and he gives it joyously under the darkest skies.
Will earth awake again? Will sunshine come?
Will life reign in evident triumph, and winter
and darkness pass? <span class='it'>Sur-e-ly, sur-e-ly, sur-e-ly,
sure!</span> The rich notes thrill with the joy of
assurance, and shake him bodily as he stands
with up-thrown head and pulsing throat, wagging
from beak to tail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But like many another of the sons of the
prophets, his gift of open vision lies close to
his love of fun. His tail jerks with a wildness
suggestive of broken gearings in his little insides,
as he dashes into his score again <span class='it'>accelerando</span>,
singing it <span class='it'>da capo</span> with a comical exaggeration
of his former style. <span class='it'>Sure-ly, sure-ly,
sure-ly, sure!</span> He cocks his head, flirts his tail,
gives me a sharp look from his sharper eye, and
whisks around the house in a twinkling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Grace Wood is coming to see me tomorrow!
I have been good and waited until I
am quite rested, and now I am to have my
reward. But I did not know until I came
home that George died two years ago. There
were never two people happier together than
they; and yet she has gone on writing to
me all this time, the same sunshiny, hopeful,
heartening letters she sent me when I first
left home. That was always Grace’s way;
everything that came to her, hurt or pleasure,
went out from her again only as help to somebody
who needed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I haven’t seen Cousin Jane yet, and David
says she’s been simmering for days and is liable
to boil over any minute. She came an hour
after I reached home, though requested to stay
away until I sent for her; but the Peon caught
her at my door and turned her back. She insisted
she had something of the greatest importance
to explain to me; but the Peon is an
awesome person when he does lay down the law,
and she hasn’t been back since. I can’t help
wondering if it is something about Caro—though
it can’t be, for I’ve been Caro’s “mother-confessor”
too long to be learning anything
about her from Cousin Jane. Besides, Caro
will be here herself in three more weeks—after
all these years and years!</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>December 9th.</span> Grace came, her old dear
self, unchanged except that the look of detachment
from herself was deepened in her clear,
sweet eyes, and about her smiling, tender
mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spoke of George as if he were still with
her—as indeed I think he is—and of Milly,
now quite grown, and sharing with Caro the
honors of Chatterton belledom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had a beautiful time together, and chatted
and giggled as we have done these forty
years whenever occasion offered; and she went
away promising to come soon again if I would
keep on getting better. And so I would have
done but for Cousin Jane. She was driving
down the pike and saw Grace, with her own
eyes, coming through the gate. She drove on
down the road a bit till Grace was out of sight,
and then swooped down on me like a blackbird
on a worm. Josie tried to stop her at the front
door; but she had known Josie from her pickaninny
days; and if she hadn’t, it wouldn’t
have mattered, for Cousin Jane is not a person
to be frustrated by darkies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knocked once, sepulchrally, on my door,
and opened it on the instant. She wore her
best Sunday air, and eyed me like a familiar of
the Holy Office about to put a heretic through
a course of sprouts.</p>

<hr class='tbk105'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Lyddy,” she began, settling weightily
into Grace’s chair, “so you lived to get back
home, after all. I hope you’re as grateful to
Providence as you ought to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her tone made it evident that, though she
might hope it, she certainly didn’t expect it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve gone off mightily in your looks,”
she continued; “not that you weren’t always
sorter peaked an’ skinny-lookin’—‘slender,’
Letitia used to call it! Do you think your
mind’s gettin’ straight any?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s straight, what there is of it,” I said;
“but I’m tired just now, Cousin Jane; I can’t
talk very well. You see Grace has been
here——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I see her?” she demanded indignantly.
“That’s why I came. If you can
see a chatterer like her, I reckon you can
see me. I told John Bird I wanted to see you
about Caroline.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My tired eyes opened at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Caroline is gettin’ grown-up; she was nineteen
last June. I’ve tried my best to keep
beaux and foolishness away from her, but
everything in town, looks like, was after her
last summer; and the worst of it was, Caroline
liked it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The corners of my mouth took an upward
curve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wait till I get through, missy, an’
you’ll be laughin’ the other side of your mouth.
Caroline is hail-fellow-well-met with every boy
in this town except David Bird; and she knows
perfectly well, for I told her, that Chadwell
and I and you and John Bird intend her to
marry David.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room swam round, and I closed my eyes.
Speech was impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good land, Lyddy! Don’t go to faintin’—I
didn’t know you were such a baby. You
needn’t get so scared, child. Jane Grackle is
pretty safe to get her own way, and long as
your way’s my way you’ll get yours, too. She’ll
marry him yet; young folks haven’t any sense;
they need managin’, and I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For heaven’s sake don’t try to manage
Caro,” I gasped. “And as for telling her I
intended her to marry David—go, before you
say something else that will make forgiveness
impossible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cousin Jane turned purple. I saw that as
my eyes closed again. She rose stiffly, with
rustling skirts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I didn’t know you’d lost what little sense
the Lord gave you, Lyddy Bird, I’d box your
ears for your impudence. I’ll go when I get
ready, miss. I didn’t tell Caroline you <span class='it'>said</span>
you intended her to marry David—I know
you’ve never said a word about it: I just took it
as a matter of course. Chadwell and I feel it
our duty to provide for her—not in money, of
course; she has quite a tidy little fortune of
her own, and of course you and John Bird expect
to leave David all you’ve got; they won’t
need anything from us. But we want to see
her settled: an’ David’s steady an’ reliable an’
a real good business boy, for all you’ve raised
him so harum-scarum; an’ it stands to reason,
with your keepin’ Caroline all the time like you
did, an’ throwin’ away the good stout clothes I
provided for her to waste your own money in
fol-de-rols, an’ good as adoptin’ her, you might
say, that you’d picked her out for David an’
meant to leave them your money. Don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I swept together my floating wits, steadied
them with a supreme effort, and considered for
an instant, while I felt Cousin Jane’s angry
stare battering at my closed lids. I must tell
her something, and nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Caro and David are like our own children,”
I said weakly; “we want their happiness, and
nothing else. If they love one another as
brother and sister, it’s quite to be expected,
don’t you think? Whatever made you think we
wanted a marriage, brought up as they have
been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean you won’t leave them the
money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean money has nothing to do with it.
We expect to do all we can for them, and to let
them be happy in their own ways, not in ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, any way suits Caroline that’s not my
way an’ that makes mischief—I can see that
plain enough, an’ I told her so. I scolded her
good. An’ it’s my opinion David’s in love with
her. I caught him lookin’ at her one day when
they were fishin’ down by the mill, an’ I just
happened to go by in the buggy. I couldn’t
get a word out of him when I asked him about
it; an’ when I told him I’d given Caroline a
talkin’-to, an’ I’d set my head on his havin’ her,
he glared at me as if I was tryin’ to murder
him, an’ told me to let Caroline alone, an’
let her marry whoever she wanted to. He
ain’t been near me since, an’ won’t hardly
speak to me; an’ Caroline behaved like a
spitfire when I went to her about it. But
I believe David’s willin’ if she’d be—but she
ain’t, yet. You may as well know there’s goin’
to be trouble when she comes home. It ain’t
like it used to be; an’ you’d better get up out
of that bed an’ be gettin’ ready to help
straighten things out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much longer she would have stayed
there I don’t know. Her voice, near and strident
as it was, was drifting off into a world
that seemed far away, when the door opened
with soft quickness and David was in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he could speak Cousin Jane was lumbering
away, his eyes driving her like bayonets.
He poured out something and held it to my
lips, and then sat stroking my hand as gently
as Caro could have done. And for days and
nights I lay here in the clutch of the old weakness
and the old pain, and scarcely heeding
either in the blackness of this new fear. I have
been trying for days to write it all down, thinking
maybe I could face it better so, and find
some way of deliverance from Cousin Jane’s
cataclysmic diplomacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Caro should marry David! Has there
ever been a time when I didn’t hope for it?
And I have never said it, even to the Peon himself,
for fear the very walls should carry the
secret and make the hope impossible: and now!
If Jane Grackle—but there’s no use railing;
when one’s hopes are in ruins it takes all one’s
strength to face the disaster; if I waste mine
in reproaches I shall turn coward, and then
Grumpy will rule my world.</p>

<hr class='tbk106'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>December 17th.</span> Gray days, with sullen
skies which will neither shine nor storm. The
mocking-birds have entered their winter silence,
and eye me indifferently as they hop
about under my windows picking up the
crumbs which Josie scatters daily for my
feathered guests. They never come together
at this time of the year. Each goes his own
path in solitude as well as in silence. But the
flickers are more sociable, and the wrens are
always in pairs. The cardinal and his wife
come together every morning, she gently indifferent
as usual, and he the devoted lover
of all the year around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over in the pasture the meadow-larks sing
half-heartedly, and a titmouse protests sturdily
against their sentimental pathos. He is
pecking at a magnolia seed tucked under his
toes as he sits in the beech at breakfast.
“<span class='it'>Here! Here! Here! Here!</span>” he exclaims. He
believes in making the best of things, does the
titmouse, and holds his crest as high these dark,
raw days as when he goes courting in a world
that is in gala attire for the occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if the pain isn’t better yet, the weakness
is; and that is always the worst part of it.
I shall be out in my wheeled-chair yet, by the
time Caro comes. And as to Cousin Jane’s nonsense,
she may make mischief—has made
it, evidently; but if they’re really made for each
other, as I have hoped for so long, surely an
old woman’s foolish tongue can never ruin
their lives. <span class='it'>Sur-e-ly, sur-e-ly, sur-e-ly, sure!</span>
Oh, bless the little red-brown seer! He tilts
on the lilac bush a second, winks at me distinctly,
and is off with a whisk of his tail which
says plainly, “Don’t be more of a fool than
you must be, old pal!” and I won’t.</p>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>December 24th.</span> How full of happiness one’s
world can be! Caro is not much bigger than
her feathered namesake out of doors, but the
place overflows with her presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was afraid Cousin Jane wouldn’t let her
stay here after the late unpleasantness, and
was lying on the south porch the other day,
trying to devise some way to make my peace
with her, when she drove around the house
and over the grass, and stopped her buggy
close to my chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Cousin Jane, I’m so glad to see you!”
I exclaimed. “I’ve been wanting to ask you
to let Caro come straight to me and stay with
us while she’s at home. I haven’t had her for
three years, Cousin Jane; and I can make it
all right with her about David, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you could do something if you
were a mind to try,” she said, with her severest
kiss-of-peace manner, which always
aroused an unreasonable combativeness in my
unregenerate soul. “I am perfectly willing,
Lyddy, to let by-gones be by-gones. I never
bear malice, even against ill-tempered folks.
I came over to say if you’d do what you
could with Caroline, I’d let her stay here. She
always was keen to please you—why, I never
could see; but she is; and I’ll not let my personal
feelin’s stand in the way when it comes
to dischargin’ my duty to that poor motherless
girl. She can come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Cousin Jane,” I said heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re welcome, Lyddy, you’re welcome:
I don’t hold anything against you. I want to
set you a Christian example: maybe it’ll have
some effect on you, now you’re all broken down
with havin’ too much of your own way. Looks
like, with all the afflictions the Lord’s sent on
you, an’ old as you are, you might be learnin’
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I suppose I am a sinner; but somehow, all
my life, whenever Cousin Jane takes her religion
in both hands and tries to ram it into
me in her best pile-driver manner, my own
scuttles off and dives into the first rat-hole it
can find; and I have a dreadful time dragging
it out again and making it help me behave. So I
took a long look at the blackbirds under the
maple, piously jabbing the English sparrows
to discourage their greediness about crumbs,
before I said soberly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe the Lord sent me any afflictions.
I think He just tries to teach me
how to get the good out of what comes, and to
rise by it. I think that’s one of His special
jobs in this world—trying to turn our afflictions
into wings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we all know you’re sorter half-cracked,
Lyddy,” said Cousin Jane, with a
manner intended to be genial. She was evidently
bent on not quarreling. “Just do
your best for Caroline.” She gathered up the
reins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cousin Jane,” I said quickly, “don’t say
a word more to Caro about—those things.
Please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do as I see fit, Lyddy,” she answered
stiffly. “Bein’ willin’ to let you help don’t
mean I can trust you to manage things. Well,
good-bye. Do try to get up an’ take some
exercise; it’ll do you good. I’m a worker, myself,
an’ always was; an’ you see how strong I
am—not but what I could complain if I wanted
to, like some.” She disappeared around the
house, tucking her buggy-robe closely around
her with one hand as she drove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So yesterday morning I was out on the front
porch, watching the road with my glasses; and
there they came, whirling in from the pike in
the open car, the top being down that I might
see her afar off. Caro was driving, and David
beamed beside her, while the Peon beamed on
the back seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole place feels her presence, and overflows
with her music, her laughter, her sweet
and tricksy ways. She is off with the young
folks in Chatterton now, helping with the
Christmas tree at the church; but before she left
she wheeled me out to my cot under the maple
tree—or superintended Uncle Milton’s doing
it, while she fluttered about with the pillows,
and scolded us for letting her do all the work.
She scattered crumbs for the birds, just as she
used to, and then cuddled down on the same
little stool where she used to sit, her curly
brown head on my pillows. Not Make-Believe
any more, thank heaven, but Caro, and the real
Bird Corners!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were silent awhile, and then she began
to talk—all the loving nonsense and little intimate
confidences that had always come when
we were alone. But not a word of David, nor
of Cousin Jane. I could not let our first talk
begin a silence between us, so I told her what
had happened. She had flushed a little at first,
but her laughter bubbled as she kissed me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweet Mammy, don’t you think I know
Cousin Jane? I knew you never said it, nor
meant it. And I’m sure you’d let me marry
the man in the moon, if I wanted to. I did get
mad with her for talking to David—that rather
passed bounds. But David’s a darling, and as
sensible as can be. We thrashed it all out afterwards,
and we aren’t going to make ourselves
unhappy because Cousin Jane’s a born
donkey and can’t help it. Don’t you bother
about it a minute. We’ll both of us get married
some of these days, and you’ll have four
children to love you instead of two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there isn’t anybody else yet?” I
asked, my face turning to hers as I lay, and
her clear eyes looking into mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think there is with David,” she said,
considering; “but as for me—Mammy Lil,
would you rather be a young man’s darling, or
marry a very old and rich and apoplectic gentleman,
worry him to death fast, and be happy
and independent forever after?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is the young man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, anybody; I haven’t decided; but I
suppose I could get one. You know I wrote
you about the boys last summer, and how wild
Cousin Jane was. She was more fun than the
boys. You don’t really want me to marry, do
you? I’m having such a good time.” She sat
up and waved her hand. “There’s Milly, and
I must go. Now, lie here and be good till I
get back, and I’ll never marry anybody you
don’t want me to.” And she ran down to the
gate, pinning her hat on as she went.</p>

<hr class='tbk108'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>December 30th.</span> Note-books are superfluous
when I can have Caro. It is so good to see one
so pretty, so eager, so joyous, so young in body
and soul. She is the very spirit of youth, with
her swift, outgoing life, her quick response to
it on all sides, her gay resourcefulness in the
little emergencies of her small world. I forget
my body, and all its pain-worn helplessness,
while she dances through the house. It
doesn’t matter so much that I must watch in
idleness while the life I love sweeps by, if
somebody else has my own vivid joy in it—a
joy unhampered by weariness or pain. No
wonder the girls can’t stir without her, nor
resent it that she draws the boys as honey
draws flies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can’t see that she cares to draw any one of
them yet, though she dearly loves to draw
them all. She is in that kitten stage which
comes to every girl alive. She wants to play,
and she finds the new game fascinating. What
the boys find it doesn’t concern her yet; she is
exploring the possibilities of the game.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How David feels toward her is more than I
can tell. He is as frankly fond of her as when
he used to carry her across the muddy places
down by the brook, and tell her fairy tales
while they popped corn by the winter fire. But
as to that look in his eyes whereof Cousin Jane
prated—well, I’ve never seen it; and I rather
doubt if she did either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet somehow I can’t help the uneasy feeling
that she has hoodooed my secret hopes. She
never had influence enough to counteract anything
other members of the family might elect
to do; but whomever she sided with was a subject
for condolence. She could never be suppressed
when she espoused a cause, and her
well-meant activities were invariably fatal to
the best-laid plans. What have I done that, in
addition to all my other afflictions, Cousin
Jane should thrust herself upon me as an ally?
I had counted so comfortingly upon her opposition.
David was never fond of her, and
it is only of late years that she has ceased to
predict for him a future of State support. It
isn’t that she’s fond of the boy now; it’s because
Cousin Chad found out how he managed
that affair for the Peon last winter, and because
the farm here at Bird Corners is becoming
one of the show places, agriculturally, of
this part of the State. And if a richer suitor
appears she’ll discard David like an old shoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I confess I am taking great comfort in the
very apparent devotion of David’s old antagonist,
Robert White. He is older than David,
and is advancing rapidly in one of the largest
banks in the city, of which his father is an important
director. Bob is a nice fellow, little
spoiled by prosperity, and his prospective fortune
quite overshadows David’s—in fact, he is
one of the “catches” of this part of the State.
He has been staying out here at his father’s
ever since Caro came home, and makes no secret
of the reason. If Cousin Jane becomes aware
of him she will espouse his cause, <span class='it'>con amore</span>,
and my own hopes will have a rosier appearance.
Poor Bob! I don’t bear him a bit of
malice; but I must shunt Cousin Jane off on
somebody!</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 5th.</span> Caro left us last night, protesting
as she went, and insisting that she would
come home in defiance of everybody if I had
any more backsets. But we all want her to
finish the year under her new singing-master:
her voice is really wonderful, and she ought not
to stop yet. The six months will be gone before
we know it; and then she will come to stay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For myself, I have stored up delight enough
in these ten days to brighten this dark January
weather for weeks to come. And the
days are already lengthening. Spring is on
the way, in fact—and summer won’t be far
behind.</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 10th.</span> What winter colors could
bedeck the world I never knew until today!</p>

<p class='pindent'>First came the rain—a soft, misty down-dropping
which fell noiselessly on the half-frozen
earth, softening the icy ridges in the
road beyond the porch, till they crunched under
Uncle Milton’s heavy feet and splashed into
the water collecting in their ruts. Long before
sunset they wheeled me back to my room, where
the thickening clouds shut us into a twilight
gloom, through which the north wind’s voice
cut icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By morning the clouds were gone, and
with them had vanished the work-a-day earth.
In its place is a world of faery, of glitter, of
fire, of pallid white. Over all the fields
the snow lies thick, down to the very edge of
the brook. But above the snow, from the
smallest weed whose skeleton shakes in the bitter
wind to the topmost twig of the tallest
tree, is silver and fire and ice. The stubble is
all one elfin glitter; and beyond the gate, along
the pike, where dried golden-rod, poke-berry,
mustard, and all earth’s wild outcast beauty
blossomed months before, are billows of frost-wrought
loveliness as pure as pearls and as
delicate as the fronds of ferns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overhead the sky is deepest blue, rich foil
and background for the trees, all silver here,
all glitter there, and everywhere starred with
flashing points of red and blue and orange, as
some jagged point of ice catches the sunlight
and tears it into dazzling shreds of color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deep blue, overhead; but everywhere along
the horizon a soft, colorless, distant sky, across
which the half-congealed moisture of the air
draw its dimming yet invisible veil. The hills
are pale, aloof; but here and there the low
sun strikes them and smites the glory of their
tree-tops into a halo of pearl and fire about
their brows. And what may be the beauty of
life more abundant when the beauty of life
withdrawn clutches the heart like this?</p>

<hr class='tbk111'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 13th.</span> There is nobody to fellowship
with today but the blackbirds and the
English sparrows. David is off lecturing at
some farmers’ institutes, and the Peon left this
morning for a week’s trip. Grumpy is here, as
usual, and the pain in my spine; but I am not
of a mind to fellowship with them; they can
sulk together in the corner if they want to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eh, but when the dark shuts out even the
scandal-mongering sparrows, the room is a bit
empty and lonesome-looking! Grumpy and the
back don’t count; they are both in the skeleton-closet.
But the key seems lost, and they have an
unpleasant way of peeping through the crack
of the door. There’s no sense in staying here
this night, so it’s ho, for Make-Believe for me!</p>

<hr class='tbk112'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 15th.</span> When one can’t have the big
things one wants, one can at least play with the
little things one has; and in doing so may
learn with growing thankfulness how great a
resource a little thing may become.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are so many playthings in the world—no
need is left unsupplied. When one is too ill
to think and too weak to look, there are fleeting
glimpses, through half-shut lids, of blue sky
beyond one’s windows, of a drifting cloud, a
flash of wings, or the waving of boughs in the
wind; beautiful pictures which return uncalled-for
to float above that sea of pain wherein one
rocks, and to steady one with a half-consciousness
of an upper world of beauty and peace,
real, though beyond one’s reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when one can think a little—oh, so
many things! One cannot possibly be cut off
from life if one’s heart be in it. It isn’t the
moving of one’s body that counts, but the
clasping of life with the heart. We really live
to the exact extent we <span class='it'>care</span>, and so find the
interest with which every atom and phase of
life is stored.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>He brought an eye for all he saw.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Was ever anything more beautiful said of
any one than that? And that is what I pray
for—the seeing eye; that, whether my body be
well or ill, I may enter in at the open doors
which swing wide on every hand, and see, and
love, and rejoice; understanding where I
may, and happy where I may not to watch,
to learn, to wonder like a child.</p>

<hr class='tbk113'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 15th.</span> The real freedom of life is
measured not by one’s liberty to do as one
likes, but by the things one can afford to do
without. And there is no poverty in such freedom:
it is through the enrichment of the inner
life that one’s resources grow great enough to
enable one to dispense with the outward things
once so necessary.</p>

<div><h1><a id='prem'></a>V<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='sc'>Premonitions</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 21st.</span> This is one of those beautiful,
balmy days which sometimes come, late in
January, to convince the veriest blind pessimist
that spring is on the way. The chickadees
are half mad, flying headlong from tree
to tree, and singing their gay little winter score
with an <span class='it'>abandon</span> unknown before. The titmice
are whistling cheerily; and the jays,
though not a hint of spring sweetness softens
their harsh tones, are dancing a little in the
hackberry as they squawk. The wren is singing
rapturously, as he has done all these sunless
weeks, not because of spring-time and April
air, but because love and life are always present
with him, and nothing else matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mocking-bird is still solitary, wrapped
in contemplation, like some prophet of old.
Nor is the cardinal singing yet. But his not
singing is no sign of faint-heartedness. Yesterday
he perched in the tulip-tree and <span class='it'>said</span>
“Cheer! Cheer! Cheer!” soberly, decidedly,
as if the sweet reasonableness of good cheer
had grown upon him through the dark January
weather. He will be singing it soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There! I’ve been out on the porch, and
written in my note-book on a bad day—the
best bad day I’ve had yet; and when bad days
are best bad days Grumpy may as well take a
back seat.</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 28th.</span> Best bad days are all very
well; but a combination of best bad days and
Cousin Jane is more grandeur than my feeble
frame can live up to. It has taken me a week
to catch up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drove up just as I closed my note-book—quite
in time to catch me in the act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tsck!” she said in disgust, as she whirled
my chair about with a strong hand and wheeled
me unceremoniously into the house. “I suppose
you want to put your eyes out next, and
have everybody pityin’ your afflictions when
you’ve made yourself blind layin’ flat on your
back an’ scribblin’ nonsense—poetry, like
enough!” Contempt could no further go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you never heard of my writing
poetry in your life, Cousin Jane,” I protested
meekly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, an’ I don’t want to. I know just the
kind of stuff it ’ud be. But I don’t see what
else you get to write layin’ out there all by
yourself, with nothin’ to see, an’ no sensible
occupation to keep you busy. I never could
abide an idler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did you hear from Caro?” I inquired.
In the interest of peace, a change of
subject seemed advisable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Caroline’s careless about writin’—which
of course I might have expected, seein’
the way you brought her up. But Bob White’s
been up there lately, an’ I saw him when I
went to town yesterday. I met him on the
street, while I was goin’ to get my new glasses,
an’ he took me up to the new hotel to lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bridled with pleasure, and I coughed
to strangle my laugh of delight. Bob White
paying court to Cousin Jane, without my meddling
the least little bit!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had four courses,” she went on in happy
retrospection. “I didn’t know there was
such a nice place in town. I don’t eat much
lunch usually when I go—looks like it ain’t
right to waste the Lord’s money just pamperin’
the flesh, as you might say; an’ besides,
I’d rather save it. I never did hold by spendin’
money for foolishness like you an’ John
Bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’m sure the Peon and I haven’t been on the
simplest kind of a lark for years; and when
we went it was usually a picnic in the woods
with the children, and the plainest of home-made
lunches; but I received this snub in silence.
Cousin Jane plunged on with her
news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bob’s heels over head in love with Caroline—that’s
easy to see. It ’ud be a good match for
her, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you said you wanted David for her,”
I objected in as dolorous a voice as I could
muster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t so favorable to David as I was,”
she answered frankly. “He’s got a mighty
ugly temper. He flared up at me downright
impudent that time I spoke to him about Caroline;
an’ he good as turned me out of your
room one day, without opening his mouth.
He’d lead Caroline a hard life. Of course I
didn’t say a word to Bob, but I saw by the way
he went on how it was. A keen business man
like him don’t go a hundred miles out of his
way to visit a girl for nothin’. I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you thought David cared,” I pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he does, let him do somethin’ to prove it,
’stead o’ settin’ like a bump on a log. I ain’t
goin’ to help him another mite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cousin Jane’s visits certainly add to one’s
list of mercies. I’ve been telling Grumpy all
the week that nothing can be very bad as long
as she no longer smiles on David, but afflicts
Bob White with her disastrous friendship.
My clouds are silver-lined indeed!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 29.</span> The first spring signs the birds
give us: we must look skyward for them, past
earth altogether. The next spring signs are
hidden deep, in those dark places where sunlight
never comes. For the violets which empurple
the long borders, like the song of the
Carolina wren, are not a sign of spring, but a
constant witness to ever-present life. They
bloom every month of the winter, just as the
bird sings. The spring-time message is brought
by something of a frailer courage than theirs—something
which must needs retrace steps
the violets have never taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So today, as the Peon wheeled me out to the
maple, he stopped at one of the jonquil beds
while I climbed down to brush aside the leaves
which protect the bulbs from frost, and to
stir the earth with loving fingers. Not yet.
Life is at work, I know, but too deep down to
be seen as yet. I drew the leaves back again,
my hands shaking a little with the joy of grubbing
in the dirt again—real outdoor dirt, that
runs clear through to blue sky on the other side,
instead of stopping at a saucer six inches from
the top of a pot. How many years! Would
I ever make up for the lost years, I wondered,
and then caught my breath and the Peon’s
hand with a laugh. For the cardinal was singing
again—<span class='it'>Cheer! Cheer! Cheer! A-wet-year!
A-wet-year! Cheer! Cheer!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a dull, cloudy day; but vision had
come to him, and what he saw he would live up
to. He sat on the grape arbor, back of the jonquil
bed, and sang, deliberately at first, stout-heartedly,
but with a rising tide of joy—<span class='it'>A-wet-year! Cheer! Cheer!</span>
A wet year seems to be
his idea of heaven and spring-time rolled into
one. Rain—and swelling life! The lost years
will be made good yet. And shall one grudge
the time for rain?</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>January 30th.</span> I ventured on the subject of
Caro with David last night, and find myself
wondering many things. The fact that I have
always admitted the children’s full right to reserve
from me any secret they wished to keep
largely accounts, I believe, for the closeness of
their confidence. And I didn’t intend to pry
now—only to open a way in case he chose to
take it, as I used sometimes to make confidences
easy for him as a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bob White is laying siege to Cousin Jane’s
favor, Davy, dear,” I said, using the baby
name he still loves in our private talks. “She
has sold him her good-will for a four-course
lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>David laughed a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worst affliction could happen to him, I
should think. What on earth does he want
with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She thinks he’s in love with Caro.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably is. Most of the fellows are; and
Bob’s nobody’s fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had cuddled his brown head under my
hand as he sat on a stool by my bed, and I
couldn’t see his face. His voice was so very
natural that it suggested an effort to make it
so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I doubt if he displayed any special
wisdom when he tried to win Cousin Jane
over—if he tried,” I said. “When you go
courting, I don’t think you’ll spend much time
on the girl’s guardians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much time on anybody, you mean, till
I get things settled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’d rather I waited with the rest,
dear, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted his head and sat facing me, stroking
my hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t talk about it, little Mammy,
even to you. But I wouldn’t mind your knowing
about it if you could understand without
words. You have always done that when I
couldn’t talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes met mine fully, his heart unveiled
behind them. That is one of the beautiful
things about David’s reserve—the secret door
he opens into it for one whom he truly loves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do understand,” I said slowly. “But,
remember, dear, a woman loves to be loved.
You musn’t have any reserves with her when
the time comes. Let her understand your love
is great enough to justify the demands it makes
upon her. If she hurts you at first, don’t try
to shield her by letting her think it’s a light
matter. Be as honest with her as you are with
yourself. And you’ll win her, dear; I know
you will. And you’ll do it all by yourself,
with no meddling nor helping from anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He straightened his broad shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do it that way or not at all, little Mammy.
Suppose somebody else—even you—helped
me to win her; it would be up to me
to hold her, wouldn’t it? And how could I
ever be sure of doing it if I hadn’t been enough
for her at the start, by myself? If I’m not
enough—if I can’t make myself enough—I
couldn’t afford to have her at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose to his full six feet of height and
stretched his clenched hands above his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That stool cramps my legs these days,” he
said. “I remember how proud I was when I
found I could sit on it squarely and get my
toes to the floor. Legs change, don’t they?
But the only way I change is to love more the
folks I love at all. Goodnight, you sweetest
mother a boy ever had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent down, rubbing his cheek against
mine in the dear caress of his baby days, and
went out. He never was a boy to kiss one;
but he always loved to stroke my hand, and to
touch my cheek with his. He always loved,
too, for me to receive his caresses passively; it
is only when he tucks his close-cropped head
under my hand that petting from me is in
order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he loves Caro. Half of my hope has
come true. And here I lie, trembling with
fear. Is there any greater mockery than a hope
wrecked by a half fulfilment? If Caro—Now
isn’t Grumpy a clever imp? I’ve faced him
down and out about the pain for nearly three
weeks, and shut him up in the skeleton-closet
with all the gruesome things I’m determined
not to be nagged about; and so he sneaks out
on an entirely new tack, and flaunts David and
Caro at me instead of my own spinal column,
which is his customary trade-mark! But if I
don’t want him associating with my own anatomy,
which heaven knows is too depraved to be
further contaminated, why should he aspire to
the children’s company? And if David loves
Caro, isn’t that proof I was right in thinking
they were made for each other, and that Caro’s
love will answer his? <span class='it'>Sur-e-ly, sur-e-ly, sur-e-ly,
sure!</span> Just hear her bird-double out of
doors: Grumpy as a prophet isn’t in it with the
little red-brown wren!</p>

<hr class='tbk117'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>February 7th.</span> Milly came to see me today.
Grace has been for more than a month with
George’s mother, who has been very ill. I was
lying here thinking of her as I watched the
jays outside, and of what Caro said when she
was at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro never could stand Cousin Jason, and
has called him Cousin Jay ever since the first
summer we came to Bird Corners. I took her
to spend the day at Grace’s, and she went with
Milly and her nurse down to the brook to wade.
The brook divides Cousin Jason’s land from
theirs; and the children, finding some of his
hogs in Grace’s pasture, drove them before
them with much laughter and little clods of
earth. Cousin Jason, hearing his squealing
beasts, came charging down the hill in a fury
and jabbed his petty wrath straight to poor
little Milly’s heart. She was always a timid
creature, like her mother, and, like her mother,
unkindness made her physically ill; so she
wept miserably, poor baby, while her half-uncle
stormed. But Caro flamed into wrath
as fierce as his own. She had been feeding the
birds that morning, and had jumped from the
stool by my cot afterward a dozen times to
scatter the jay-birds, who were out in unusual
force, and bent on pecking off the head
of any other bird who ventured to take a
crumb. She sprang in front of Milly now,
ruffling like an angry wren.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go home, you horrid—jay-bird!” she
shrieked; “you peck, an’ peck, an’ peck, <span class='it'>all</span>
the time! I hate you! Cousin Jay, Cousin
Jay!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at the mite, speechless, with purpling
face. Milly gasped with fright, and old
Aunt Susan, as she afterwards declared, “done
choke herse’f ’mos’ ter death swallerin’ her
laff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro took Milly by the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go home an’ play party,” she proposed
calmly; “we don’t like pigs and jay-birds.”
And back they went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cousin Jason was immensely impressed. He
told me about it afterwards, himself, and declared
that he wished Milly had a little of
Caro’s “spunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He even tried, in his not very happy fashion,
to be friends with the child, and has always
treated her with more consideration than any
one else he knows. But Caro will have none
of him, and to this day calls him Cousin Jay
to his face. He is a man of large bulk, with
a face at once sharp and heavy, as unlike Grace
in body as he is in soul. And I’m afraid he
makes life pretty hard for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When her husband died, Grace was left
sole mistress of his estate—which included, according
to our beautiful state law, the plantation
she inherited from her father. But her
brother calmly assumed the management of
everything. Cousin Jason is really a Mohammedan
born out of due place. He cannot
conceive of a woman’s having mind or soul
of her own, much less rights; and he proposes,
in all honesty, to do his next-of-kin duty by
the widowed family fool. Grace, I suppose,
was too broken by grief to realize what she
was doing; but in any event she would probably
have given way to him; she spent her
girlhood, as she now spends her widowhood,
trying to keep her half-brother in a good
humor. She yielded to him absolutely, even
to giving him power of attorney over all her
belongings, and to vacating her own pretty
rose-colored bed-room, with its private bath,
on the first floor of her home. Cousin Jay
never liked to sleep upstairs; it was too far
from his work, he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He has certainly, the Peon says, made everything
pay well; he has Cousin Chad’s own
genius for money-making. But he does not
believe in spending money, nor, of course, in
giving it; nor in being bothered with “idle
gossiping women who ought to be at home
minding their husbands’ affairs.” (He is never
conscious of a woman except as the appendage
of some man.) So Grace controls neither
her own money nor her own home. All her
gracious hospitality, her wise open-handedness
to those in need, is a thing of the past. It is
difficult for Milly even to have ordinary visitors,
except in the afternoons; and if it were
not for the child’s other-worldly beauty, before
which the judgments applied to most girls are
abashed, one would almost call her dresses
shabby. But it is not easy to think of her
dress, the girl herself so charms one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She has been telling me a little of her troubles,
poor child; they have been hard to manage
in her mother’s absence. Chief among them,
as I infer, mainly from what she did not say,
is the difficulty of being properly courteous to
Robert Lincoln, without calling down Cousin
Jason’s boorish wrath on the young man’s head,
as well as her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see it isn’t as if he were one of us,
Cousin Lil,” she said, her soft cheeks flushed,
her eyes large with unshed tears: “he’s a Northerner,
you know, a New Englander. He’s
interested in the interurban lines they’re building
and projecting here in Tennessee, and he
really lives in the city—I mean his headquarters
are there. And when he comes down
here to see us, why, it isn’t real Southern
hospitality not to ask him to a single meal. But
I daren’t. And once Uncle Jason came right
into the parlor and banged the fire-irons
around and glared and kept looking at his
watch. And it was only half-past nine, Cousin
Lil. That was just after Caro went back;
and he really hasn’t been here since. I
do hate for <span class='it'>Northern</span> people to think——” a
tear slid down one cheek; but the slight shrinking
of her pretty hand showed me she could
not bear to be petted just now; she did not
want sympathy, but help. She swallowed
hard and went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you know next morning at breakfast
I spoke to him—not to criticise, you know,
nor anger him, of course. I told him not to be
afraid that I would forget his wishes; that I
told every one it kept him awake to have anyone
stirring after ten o’clock at night, and that
Mother and I always closed the house then;
and I said it was only half-past nine last
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he just stormed, like he always does,
you know. He said he wanted to go to bed
early. And he got up without eating his breakfast,
and slammed the door and went out. I
had to run clear to the barn after him and beg
and beg, before he would come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth did you want him back
for?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, to eat his breakfast. He hadn’t had
his coffee, and he’d have had a headache without
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milly Wood!” I gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother always coaxes him back,” said Milly,
with gentle finality; “at least, she always
tries. Sometimes he won’t come, and then she
takes it to him herself. You know he has
terrible headaches sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, dear, if you would only face him
down just once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I couldn’t,” said Milly, shrinking.
“And Mother would never get over it. You
don’t know how she feels about Uncle Jason.
She says he’s never had the best of life, because
he never has known the love that can give
its all. She’s sorry for him, and she wants us
to make up to him for what he has missed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you’ll never do it,” I said. “Nobody
but Jason Blue can ever make good that
loss to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes I think Mother ought to require
some things of him,” she said; “but she
won’t; and I know I’ll never make it harder
for her by doing what she doesn’t want. But
I wish he didn’t live at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed me, smiling rather forlornly, and
went away, while I lay here wondering about
Mr. Lincoln, whom I have never seen. But
David and Caro liked him, which is sufficient
passport to my favor.</p>

<hr class='tbk118'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>February 12th.</span> The mocking-birds have a
constant fascination for me—the charm of a
complex nature which touches life on many
sides. One can know a robin by heart in a
single season, and predict with one’s eyes shut
the doings of any one of the tribe; but a mocking-bird
is a different proposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His song throbs with the pure joy of living.
It is the song of one in the world and
of it, and rejoicing so to be; yet there is in it
a haunting suggestion of aloofness, of mystery,
of something beyond one’s ken. It is as if his
joy had deeper foundations than sunshine and
plenty; as if he had lived through pain, clear
to the other side of it, and learned that it, too,
is good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His powers of mimicry, I think, are greatly
exaggerated. He does not really sing other
birds’ songs, as his cousin, the catbird, does; he
merely experiments with their notes—a stave
from a thrasher here, a light-flung oriole measure
there, a thrush note, piercing sweet, a bit
of the wren’s summer trill. It is as if he would
try life on all sides and look at it from every
point of view; his ear is keen for the music
from every throat. But always, through all
this imaginative performance, he clings to the
integrity of his own message. One may hear a
catbird for an hour, and, unless one sees the
blithe gray mime among the leaves, never suspect
his real identity. But all a mocking-bird’s
borrowed notes are woven into the texture of
his own song, which wholly claims him as the
melody rises, sweeping him with it bodily up to
heaven, and carrying the listener’s heart with
him. His is the rapture of open vision, feathered
mystic that he is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, a bird like that one would expect to
be a recluse, dwelling apart in cloistered green,
afar from his fellows and from mankind; but
the mocking-bird flatly declines that rôle. He
is a bird of affairs, friendly and neighborly
withal, a haunter of men’s doorways and house-vines,
and a public-spirited citizen who rejoices
to succor the oppressed. For he has a fine,
full-fledged temper of his own, and any amount
of fighting blood. He rarely seeks a quarrel;
but if one be thrust upon him, either by aggressions
attempted upon his own rights or by
the call of another bird in distress, he accepts
the combat with alacrity, and carries it joyously
to a triumphant conclusion. And three
minutes after the enemy is routed his voice
floats down from the highest perch in the vicinity
as if he were singing at heaven’s gate.
He has fought for all he is worth, yet not a
feather of his spirit is ruffled.</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>February 15th.</span> When I can catch Grumpy
and call him to his face by his right name, he
always disappears; but blue devils are so very
clever at disguising themselves, and at concentrating
one’s attention on their instruments
of torture!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This morning, for instance, he hid under the
foot of my bed, and kept poking up all sorts
of things where I couldn’t help seeing them;
the things the Peon and David need me to get
well for; the things I long to do; the idleness
I so desperately hate—for he can make even
an abstraction visible, being a very clever devil
indeed. Then he held up the pain, turning it
round and round, and counting off the time
like a clock—minutes, hours, days, months,
years, and never an end in sight. I had to look
out of the window in self-defense; and there I
saw a kinglet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except the winter wren and the humming-bird,
the kinglets are the smallest birds we
have. But they make up in energy what they
lack in size; and this one dashed about as if
his very life depended on his getting his breakfast
in ten seconds and catching the seven-thirty
breeze to Somewhere. Grayish-olive,
of course; but was his crown of ruby-red, or of
orange, crimson and black? And why should
a mite of the tree-tops be so inconsiderate as to
carry his trade-mark on the top of his head?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was almost in despair about him—for
when you meet a bird, it is of consuming importance
to know whose acquaintance you have
the pleasure of making—when he took pity on
me of his own sweet will. Perhaps the breeze
was a thought late, and he had a moment to
spare: but he perched on a twig just outside
the window, bowed his tiny head toward me,
thrust one claw up between his wing and his
body, and scratched the back of his neck for
the whole of one second and a half!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Golden-crowned! The cunningest striped
pate, red in the middle, with a yellow band on
each side, a black band next the yellow, and a
white line over his eye. Then he flung up his
head as boldly as though it were mountain-high,
jerked his wee tail-feathers frantically, and
squeaked in the finest and most wiry of voices,
the astonishing information that it was only
Grumpy under the bed, at his old tricks—a
creature for nobody to pay attention to. And
as soon as he found himself discovered, my blue
devil took himself off.</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>February 20th.</span> If I can’t go outdoors, outdoors
can come to me! The windows are all
open this morning, and my bed so close under
them that I can lie here and stretch my hand
into the outside world, where the lilac is rapidly
leafing and the elms and maples are all abloom.
A moment ago Uncle Milton stepped into
view, one hand holding his hat and the other
filled with jonquils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is you gittin’ er little better, honey?” he
inquired. “Hit’s gittin’ spring-time now, en
Milton wants ter see you ridin’ roun’ in dat
ar cheer you got. Ef we-all puts er mattress
in it, don’ you reckon we kin git you down ter
de holler by de gate? Des see what come f’um
down dat er way dis mawnin’—dem holler jonquils
allus did beat dese yere up on de hill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached the flowers through the window
and laid them upon the bed—the first
flowers of the awakening year; for the violets
are ageless, belonging neither to the new year
nor to the old. I caught up the golden beauty
with a gasp of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you, Uncle Milton! I knew
spring was coming true before long! And I’ll
be walking down there when they bloom again:
don’t think I’m going to live in beds and
wheeled-chairs forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His brown old face beamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dat’s de talk!” he exclaimed gleefully.
“Ef dat ain’t de Forest sperrit my name ain’t
Milton, sho’! You look like yo’ pa endurin’
er de war. You keep talkin’ dat erway, honey,
en feelin’ dat erway, too. Hit’s sperrit en
spunk what cyores folks a sight mo’ dan doctors
en physicin, I lay my little Missy gwinter
be runnin’ roun’ yere yet, makin’ ole Milton
hop.” He walked off, chuckling to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Josie brought me a vase, and I set the flowers
in it as flowers should be set, lovingly, and
one by one. It has been years since I have been
down in that hollow, just this side of where the
road turns out into the pike; but I can see it
as if I were there this minute—the maples
blooming overhead, the meadow-larks flashing
the white of their tail-feathers as they fly, singing,
on the hill beyond; the twigs in the strip
of woodland down the road, shining yellow,
tan, and red with the rising sap. The blue-grass
is under foot, soft and thick, and all
through it rise the spears of the jonquil leaves,
and the swinging, golden bells. Along the
fence runs the broad band of iris, matted close,
the pointed leaves already taller than the jonquils.
Cardinals and mocking-birds are calling
all up the hillside; and down under the willows
and sycamores at the water’s edge the myrtle
warblers are swarming, and thinking of donning
their gay spring suits. Oh, I can see it
all, all! A little wind is dancing along the hillside,
and the branches touch one another softly,
the dry, scraping, winter sound all gone.
The wren’s spring song is in full blast, the
bluebirds are twittering, and even the jays’
voices are turning sweet. The breath of life
is everywhere, and the joy of it. I can feel the
wind in my hair, and the grass under my flying
feet—<span class='it'>My flying feet</span>! For a moment I
had forgotten. But here are the four close
walls, the narrow bed, the endless, wrenching
pain. And I could not walk even to my sofa
today, though the Peon’s life were my reward.—Eh,
well, and what of that? Did I not run
in Make-Believe? And shall I shut my eyes
to joy and beauty because my locomotive
apparatus is laid up for a few repairs? I may
be walking clear out to the hall again before
the week is out, and be out in my chair on the
porch tomorrow. Love and sunshine really
are enough, no matter what Grumpy says—even
love without the sunshine: and here are
both, and flowers besides, and the spring-time
everywhere out of doors.</p>

<hr class='tbk121'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>February 25th.</span> Grace was here yesterday.
She has a way of dropping in when she is most
wanted and leaving a trail of sunshine behind
her. She is a quiet little body, never hurried
or fretted, and she has a genius for discovering,
in the most unlikely places, virtues invisible
to the naked eye. She sees the wrong and
mean things, too—she’s not at all a goody-goody
person; but she keeps the wrong and
the wrong-doers so entirely distinct and separate
that you wonder how you were ever so
stupid as to confuse them. She’s really devoted
to that cranky old half-brother of hers. She
is always commiserating him because he did
not have her mother, and his own died when
he was born. She’ll explain and expound him
till you think he really is noble, only he never
had a chance to learn how to do noble things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is certainly a pity, however, that his education
is in such a backward stage. Robert
Lincoln and Milly are becoming much more
than friends; and Cousin Jason’s infantile ignorance
of other people’s rights is anything
but conductive to comfort under the circumstances.
But Grace’s one idea, as usual, is that
dear brother Jason must not be crossed. He
takes it so hard, poor fellow, when things don’t
go as he wishes. And if Mr. Lincoln is as seriously
fond of Milly as he professes to be, he
may as well make up his mind to be satisfied
with winning her, if he can succeed in doing it,
and not be too exacting with her relatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Grace! As if I don’t know the kind
of young-ladyhood she believes in Milly’s having,
and is simply aching to give her! But evidently
Cousin Jason’s will is to be law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth is, as I told Grace, Cousin Jason
is just like Cousin Chad—though they’d
both foam at the mouth to hear me say it. But
they’ve neither of them any sense of proportion.
That’s why they have no sense of
humor, nor power to get their own personalities
in proper perspective with other people
and their rights. But why, asks Grace calmly,
shouldn’t we be as sorry for a person born with
no sense of proportion as for a person born
with only one eye? Of course the lack of a
sense of humor is harder on the kin than the
lack of an eye would be—Grace admitted that
handsomely; but in neither case was the afflicted
party to blame. And didn’t one really
deserve more sympathy when his affliction
necessitated his also being a bore?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We fell to giggling as we discussed this
knotty point; and I was so far converted to
Grace’s charitable views that I had Uncle
Milton get a basket of double jonquils for her
to take to Cousin Jane. Cousin Jane always
did admire my double jonquils, and somehow
her own never succeed. I like the single ones
much better myself; the others, like my revered
relative, are too clumsy and fat. I told
Grace to say I sent them to her on the principle
of sweets to the sweet. And now I’ll be
having another visitation, for my sins!</p>

<hr class='tbk122'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>February 27th.</span> Pitch dark when I woke
this morning; and pain to make one clench
one’s teeth. Grumpy is not hilarious company
at such times, but occasionally he helps by
overdoing things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This morning, for instance, he began about
the unendingness of things—sickness, and the
long night, and all that—till it struck me all
at once it really was morning that second, and
only looked like night. Besides, the pain is
like this, often, when I don’t feel blue a bit:
so it isn’t the pain that makes me miserable—it’s
my own mood about the pain; and if a
seasoned old party like me can’t manage her
own moods, what’s the world coming to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only, sometimes I can’t manage them, and
I don’t know why. They sweep over me like
the waves of the sea, and trample me like wild
horses. It isn’t often like that; but when it is,
I know I’m in for it—and also that I’m dead
sure to get out of it after a while. I’m lying
here—this racketty old body, with a piece of
me, myself, inside it, just about as miserable
as such a combination can get to be. And the
rest of me is hanging around outside, looking
on, and saying, “Just lie low and keep quiet,
old lady. It’s tough, but it won’t last. Lay your
nose to the wind and let it howl. If it blows
you even on both sides, you’ll get out of it
without being crank-sided, and that’s the best
you can do.” So I lie here; and after awhile
the comfort of knowing it’s just a mood
soaks in till I can feel it and get the good of
it—and then the storm is past. I come out of
it, too, with my self-respect unimpaired; because,
no matter how it raged inside, I did
keep quiet on the outside till it blew over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it blew over this time also. And after
awhile even Grumpy was forced to admit that
it was morning, for all the world was drenched
with light. The long, level beams slipped
across the hills as the sun rose, and touched the
tree-tops, one by one; and behold, life had
risen—in the night. Every twig of the
tulip-tree was tipped with green where the
great terminal buds had burst their sheaths;
and down by the brook a fairy mist of color
clung tenuously about the willows. The
mocking-bird was in a rapture of prophecy in
the maple; and the English sparrows were
actually housebuilding in a beautiful hole in
the scarlet oak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody else thinks of nest building yet;
but among the birds, as among humans, the increase
of population is most rapid where one
would fain find it least. These sparrows will
be rearing half a dozen families before the
year is out—good, large families, too; and it
behooves them to select their apartment early
in the season. That hole belongs to the wrens,
but that’s of no consequence to the sparrows,
who have the pleasant habit of taking whatever
they want.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be owned they are a hardworking
tribe, even though their works be evil. If
the fathers left their wives to do all the work,
after the bluebirds’ fashion, some of the broods
would surely starve; the mothers would succumb
to nervous prostration before all the
mouths could be filled. But the head of the
family rolls up his feathers and pitches right
in, from nest building days until frost. Nuisances
though they be, there isn’t a shirker
among them; and they will drop their petty
personal squabbles instantly, to make common
cause against any bird, big or little, not of
sparrow feather. But they shall not have the
wren’s hole for all that—not while Uncle
Milton can climb a tree for me.</p>

<hr class='tbk123'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>March 6th.</span> The blackbirds are falling in
love. Even sensible, lovely creatures are a
bit comical when hard hit by the tender passion.
In its first inflammatory stages it so
utterly destroys the patient’s sense of proportion
that one smiles even when one’s heart is
aglow with sympathy. But a blackbird lover,
a sleek, slick gentleman, oppressed with more
dignity than an archbishop could carry gracefully,
trying to unlimber enough to convince
his <span class='it'>inamorata</span> that he desires her favor when
he merely wishes to air his perfections for her
dazzlement!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One flies to a branch in plain sight of the
greedy black gang, gobbling crumbs below,
and meditates. Shall he condescend, or shall
he not? Well, maybe she is worth it; and
it will display his feathers to an admiring
world. He ducks a little, spreads wings and
tail, rises a-tiptoe, and says something through
his nose to call attention to his noble self,
though a compliment may be tacked on in the
last note. I know that’s just the way Cousin
Chad did it when he courted Cousin Jane. And
think of the laughterless depths of Cousin
Jane’s soul that she found it a performance
to take seriously! Things are pretty much
evened up in this life, after all. It is true
Cousin Jane has no back; but think of a blackbird
husband—and of me with the Peon!</p>

<hr class='tbk124'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>March 10th.</span> Rain, rain, rain. I’ve been
examining my mercies this morning to see
which of them can stand the strain of a three-days’
cold down-pour, a week of almost utter
sleeplessness, and a spine that is conducive
to profanity. The mercies look badly frazzled;
but they were all right the other day, and
couldn’t possibly wear out as fast as this. I
suppose it’s the same old trouble—my eyes are
moth-eaten, and need to be done up in camphor
at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anyway, it’s a piece of a mercy that if I had
to get so much worse I did it in weather when
I couldn’t go outdoors if I were able. It is
awfully cold. Grumpy says it will frost when
it clears off, and all the peaches will be killed.
Cheerful, isn’t it, when David’s pet peach-orchard
experiment is in full bloom for the
first time? But the peach trees are like us
humans: they never can tell what is ahead of
them. They have to go on in the dark with
such capital of good-will and ignorance as they
possess, and take the consequences without
kicking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think the titmice might be counted as
mercies today. The other birds have disappeared,
but the titmice are as jaunty as possible
in their trim gray rain coats, whistling like
boys calling dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And pray, if a titmouse can keep his crest
starched in this down-pour, why should the
spirit of mortal be limp?</p>

<hr class='tbk125'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>March 12th.</span> If one be born a coward, one
cannot help that; and what one cannot help is
no disgrace, but a burden to be carried in
patience to the end of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in my childhood it came to me that
though one be born a coward beyond escape, it
is never necessary to behave like one. That has
been my comfort a thousand times, and it is
my comfort tonight—a comfort great enough
to hold me steady in the iron grip of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coward I am, and will be, to the end of
life. But I have not behaved like a coward
this day! And now the day is ended—lived
through forever. And I can remember it unashamed.</p>

<div><h1><a id='before'></a>VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='sc'>Before the Dawn</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>March 18th.</span> If the outward pressure of
necessity for self-control be great enough to
balance the inward pressure of pain, one can
keep fairly steady. But a week after the Peon
left on one of those long western trips something
came up that made it necessary for
David to drop everything and go to Atlanta.
He was detained there beyond his expectations,
and then wrote me he must go to New
York before returning home. He begged me
again, as when he first left, to send for Grace;
but I did not want her. At first it was a relief
to be alone, with no need for effort or
concealment. Afterwards, I did not want her
because her sympathy would have been more
than I could bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It wasn’t just the day’s pain, or the night’s—one
can usually manage that somehow.
What Grumpy did was to set today’s pain by
that of yesterday, and the day before that;
to add last week’s to last year’s, to the pain of
ten years, twenty years, back. He applied his
recollections like a mustard plaster, and rubbed
them in like a liniment. Then he took tomorrow,
and next year, and the year after
that, and built them all into one long <span class='it'>via dolorosa</span>—a
life-time path of pain. I might have
stood that; I have before. But beside the pain
he set the idleness—this horrible, useless idleness.
That is the killing part! He set it all
before me, as plain in the black and sleepless
nights as in the day: and while I cowered, he
gibed and threatened till I feared to look
ahead and dared not hope. And when I tried
to run away to Make-Believe, for the first time
in all my life I could not find the way! That
finished everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I lay still and silent one age-long night,
shut fast in my body at last, the slow tears
dripping on my pillow on either side. Suddenly,
in the dawning, a purpose leaped
within me; Ella should come to me—here, in
this very room, from which I could no longer
escape. If Make-Believe were closed to me,
I would command her here. I would tell her
everything: I could not bear it in silence any
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since we first went to the city I had loved
her. And after Great-aunt Letitia died, until
she went North to live, she had been constantly
in my home. And after that—oh, we
knew the way to Make-Believe, we two! Never
a day but we met there, for many a year. She
knew all about the pain, though we never spoke
of it. It wasn’t merely that words were unnecessary,
but that pain, in her presence,
seemed so small a part of life. Nothing really
mattered but love and kindness and happy
human laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet she had never had a real home, nor
even a care-free childhood. Her life had been
one long sacrifice for those who took her bounty
as their right. But the laughing blue eyes,
the heart of kindness, the sturdy, sensible,
joyous spirit of her, blended of love and humor
and common sense! The children in the streets
ran after her, and tired faces brightened as
she passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three years and a half now I had not
seen her, even in Make-Believe, where I met
every one else I love, both living and dead.
Somehow I could not pretend about her any
more, after that strange day when my letter
came back unopened—the happy letter I had
written to tell her I was going to a sanitarium
to be made over new, so that I could come
and pay her a “really truly” visit on my way
home. She never saw the letter. They sent
it back unopened; and I could not play about
her any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now, if I must stay shut in my body,
she must come. She should never leave me.
I would tell her every day just how hard life
was. And she would be sorry for me; she
would understand. I reached out with all the
life left in me to draw her out of Make-Believe,
now shut against me, and bring her to share
my prison, and to hear my complaints.</p>

<hr class='tbk126'/>

<p class='pindent'>I turned my head upon the pillow and lifted
my heavy lids. She was coming toward the
bed. I raised my arms feebly, and her own
were round me. My head fell on her breast,
and I lay there, drawing long, sobbing breaths,
while she stroked my hair with firm and gentle
fingers. There was no need for speech: her
touch was always plainer than other people’s
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But presently I was aware of a difference
in her touch, a something new and strange. I
whispered weakly, without opening my eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it dear? What troubles you?
Why don’t you speak to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence. Only that tender, pitying touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you’d be sorry for me,” I whispered
on; “and oh, I want you to be! I
wouldn’t have called you if it were real, you
know—I wouldn’t hurt you for the world.
But nothing can hurt you now. Isn’t Love
so plain to you, and the end of things, and
the reasons why they must be—isn’t all that
so shining clear to you that even my being
like this can’t hurt? Tell me about it. I
want to know it is clear to somebody—I’m
so far gone in the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then be sorry for me,” I went on, dashing
my desperate pleading against that strange,
disquieting silence. “I’ve borne so much. I
must tell somebody, and it isn’t fair to talk
about it to them here at home. I’ve never
talked to anybody before, even to you. I’ve
never even cried, never once, except all by
myself in the dark. And I’m such a coward
about everything, and specially about pain;
I’ve been so afraid of it all my life. And it
never stops. It’s been years, Ella, years and
years. And oh, I can’t bear it any more! You
don’t know what it’s like just to be still and
suffer when you can’t <span class='it'>do</span> anything. It wasn’t
so bad when I could keep going; I could
fight. But now I can’t fight any more. I
want to die. I think God ought to let me die.—I’ve
tried; I’ve tried my best so long. And
I can’t try any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were scarcely breathed, and I
stopped in exhaustion, the slow tears dropping
on her breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still she did not speak. Deeper and deeper
sank her silence, pressed in by that strange,
tender touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly I shivered, and my eyes flew wide.
Her own were full of love and sorrow—a sorrow
that looked past all my complaints to
something deeper and more vital. I shrank
away from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” I said. “I can’t any more; I
can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind the sorrow in her eyes a light
was kindled; but it only frightened me the
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have tried,” I protested. “I’ve done
nothing else the most of my life. Is there
no pity, even in you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still she gazed; and something in her look
called to something dead in me. I shook my
head feebly and closed my eyes; but through
the shut lids her gaze commanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come to the end,” I persisted;
“and if you do not understand, there is nothing
left. I can’t try any more, and I won’t. Go
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gasped as I said it, and opened my eyes
again. Her look pierced and held me like the
point of a sword. I turned my head from
side to side, shivering, but there was no escape.
The dead thing in me stirred to life and dragged
itself up to look truth in the face once
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “It is true. I can’t because
I won’t. I thought I wouldn’t because I
couldn’t, but that is a lie. I can endure if I
will—and if I can, I must. But will it never
end?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lifted her head a little. Her eyes shone,
and a smile curved the sweet corners of her
mouth. It was not the old, brave, happy
laughter, but something wiser and more compelling—the
overflow of an exhaustless joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>know</span>,” I whispered. “You learned
it even in your life down here. And to keep
on trying is to conquer, isn’t it?—even though
one fails with every breath. And the only
irreparable calamity is to turn coward and
quit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face was heavenly sweet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must never send for you again?” I asked,
like a child. “Not to say things are hard, or
to cry?—But if I play, in the real Make-Believe,
will you talk to me there as you used?
If I see you there I won’t need you this way
again. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her fingers brushed my hair once more as
I lay back on the pillow; and then I knew
she was gone.—O bravest friend! Not even
in my own coward thoughts could your
courage be bent to the service of fear; to think
of you was to find strength, even against my
will!</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long time I lay there, while the slow
day passed and twilight deepened again into
night. All her life passed before me—its selflessness,
its courage, its joy. No creature
that knew her went unblessed of her. What
gifts pain brought, what power of helpfulness,
what fullness of life and love!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, there in the deep stillness, it was
as if the night were drawn away like a veil;
and I saw out to the very edges of the world,
and back into far-off ages, and on into days
that are yet to be; and everywhere was light.
And the light came from countless faces; and
I knew that to each one pain had come—pain
of body or pain of soul—and because of the
pain they had found the light. And down,
under the light, looking up to it, drawn by
it, stumbling forward by it, were those to
whom the vision had not come. And I—was I
offered such a fellowship only to run away in
fear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The veil of night fell dark again, but a
song was in my heart. When daylight came
I wrote it down—the song my friend had
given me. It is called</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>April 2nd.</span> The Peon came home ten days
ago, and David a day later. They looked as
solemn as owls, and developed a tendency to
neglect their business and sit in my room which
was fast getting on my nerves. So I rose
up and put a stop to it. You simply can’t
lie still in peace when your eyes won’t stay
open, if you have any consciousness that
somebody is watching you while he’s pretending
to read a book. And I don’t need a
doctor. I’ve been like this, and worse, a thousand
times, and the Head said when I came
home I was bound to get well crab-fashion—going
backward lots of the time. So I laid
down the law that if my eyes were shut and
I didn’t speak when they opened the door, my
family was to be sensible and go away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was why I didn’t look when the door
opened one day last week. I was thinking
of all the Head had said about backsets, and
how, when they ended, I would come out of
them more and more quickly, and they’d be
farther and farther apart; and I was wondering
how fast I’d go, once I had finished with
this one. When the door opened I hadn’t the
energy to spare for talking—I needed it for
my cheerful speculations. But, instead of
going away, my visitor came quietly in. Then
I heard a little gasp, a soft rustle beside me,
and little warm hands caught mine—Caro’s
hands! She was there on her knees, her face
hidden in the bedclothes, and crying as if her
heart would break! Caro crying was a sight
to galvanize a graven image: I sat up straight
in the bed and drew her to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, what is it?” I implored. “Tell me
quick: I’ll fix it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bubbled with laughter as she caught me
in her arms and eased me back on the pillow,
dropping a tear and a kiss on my nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You darling! If you were at your own
funeral and heard one of us crying, you’d hop
right up and straighten things out for us,
wouldn’t you? There’s not a thing the matter
with me except I’ve been so homesick for you
all winter I couldn’t stand it any longer: and
now I’m crying because I’m so glad I’m home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Caro——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ‘Caro’ me and don’t ‘but’ me, for
I’ve come to stay. Mammy Lil, you’re an
accomplished liar; but when your writing kept
looking like chicken-tracks, I knew better than
to believe a word of your sprawly, rickety
tales that trailed all over the sheet. And I
<span class='it'>hate</span> music. And besides, I can drive the family
to drink with what I know already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Daddy Jack, dear, and Cousin Jane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy Jack says he wrote for me yesterday—after
I’d started, all by my smart self.
And I’ll tell Cousin Jane after a while. She’ll
have something brand-new to lecture us about
for the next twenty-five years. I feel like
Carnegie and Rockefeller rolled into one: it
isn’t often she gets the benefaction of an enormity
like this, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a cloudy morning, dark, and
wet with the night’s rain; but now the sunlight
swept across the hills and up from the
branch, and struck through the soft colors
shimmering about the trees like rainbows in
a mist. The Peon and David tiptoed in, beaming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better let us go by and break the
news to them at Cousin Chad’s,” said David;
“you’ll get a shock over the ’phone if they
aren’t prepared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going over there this afternoon,” said
Caro calmly. “I’m going all by myself and
engineer Cousin Jane through the boiling-over
process; she’ll be all right when she settles
down to a simmer. Now get out, both of you:
Mammy Lil and I want to rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slipped into her kimono and stretched
herself beside me, holding my arm across her
breast and stroking it with a light touch which
expressed everything without words. Once in
awhile she talked a little in her own sweet,
whimsical way, and then lapsed again into the
silence of utter content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned my head to speak to her presently,
and found her gone. The shadows, which had
been dancing up toward the house when the
sun came out, had lengthened all down the
lawn to the valley, and across it to the hills
on the other side. I lay watching them with
that long-lost sense of refreshment which follows
unbroken sleep. Down by the gate David
was letting in Caro’s pony-cart and climbing
to a seat beside her. Presently their laughter
floated through the windows, and then she
was in the room again, perched on the window-seat
by the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m trying not to be proud, Mammy Lil,”
she observed in a chastened voice; “but Cousin
Jane is done to a turn, and almost cool enough
to set away in the cellar. She’s pleased with
me, too; she said if she just could have kept
Lyddy from meddlin’ she believed she could
have raised me up to be a real comfort to her.
Why didn’t you let her? She gave me some
outing cloth to make into petticoats for a missionary
box that’s to go west. Who but Aunt
Jane would bestow fuzzy petticoats on missionaries
in the spring? But she bought the
stuff at a bargain sale for four cents a yard,
and feels that it’s providential; and we can
put in plenty ourselves to make up for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she won’t fuss about your staying
here?” I asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course she’ll fuss; how could she
get any fun out of it if she didn’t? But she’s
fussed all she’s going to right now; and next
time I’ll make some more petticoats, or cut
down her fifth-best winter coat for one of the
little missionaries to wear on the Fourth of
July. ——Don’t look so horrified, Mammy
Lil; you know I’ll never let it get in the box!
Now lie still like a good child till I fix your
supper. I’m going to feed you myself,” and
she fluttered away, singing under her breath.</p>

<hr class='tbk127'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>April 5th.</span> Caro is in the window-seat,
feather-stitching the missionary petticoats,
with one eye on the birds in the yard. The
jays have always roused her special ire; and
yesterday one flew to the hackberry, in plain
sight, with a little naked nestling dead in his
wicked bill, tucked it coolly under his toes
against the bark, and devoured it before our
eyes. This morning, in the intervals of courtship,
they have diverted themselves with
crumb-snatching. They sit on a limb above
the scattered morsels where a dozen or more
birds are feasting. There is bread in abundance
for all, but the jays love hectoring even
better than eating. One will watch till some
bird picks up a crumb, and then drop like lead
upon his astonished victim. The unfortunate
drops the crumb, of course; and before he
collects his scattered wits the jay is back aloft
with the morsel safe under his toes, picking
leisurely. Caro sat laughing and scolding till
a little red-brown wren flew down and was
pounced upon in a twinkling. The wren dropped
his crumb, but turned upon the bully with
lightning quickness and a volcanic explosion
of wrath utterly out of proportion to his size.
The big bird, amazed at the onset, flew up to
his perch in a panic, and Caro clapped her
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, grand! grand!” she cried; “don’t I
wish Milly Wood were here to see! I told
her yesterday if she’d lay Cousin Jason out
she could manage him: and just look at that
blessed wren.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milly isn’t a wren, though,” I said: “she
hasn’t a glimmering of the wren’s gift of
speaking his mind. Look at the wood-thrush,
dear; you see the difference? When the wood-thrush
turns on a jay, I’ll have hopes of Grace
and Milly—and not before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two wood-thrushes have been in the
yard for days, the shyest, gentlest of creatures,
ready to fly off at the flutter of a leaf. They
have not touched the crumbs yet, but hop
nearer every day. The jay watched one of
them extract a worm from the soil, however,
and lit upon him plummet-fashion. The wood-thrush
dropped his half-swallowed morsel and
fled in a panic to the black ash, where my
glasses revealed him, his breast feathers bristling
with terror, a mere puff-ball of fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s Milly,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Mammy Lil, anything can run a jay
if it will only stand up to him,” persisted Caro;
“I don’t see why Milly submits to it. She
can’t ask Mr. Lincoln to a single meal. When
he comes out in the afternoon he has to motor
all the way to Chatterton for his supper and
then go back; and Cousin Jay goes in the
parlor when he does come, and glares at him
and looks at his watch, and yawns—he’s simply
insufferable. I’ve asked them both over here;
Milly can stay all night, you know. But she
says she won’t dare to come often, or Uncle
Jason won’t like it. Not like it, indeed! I
wish he belonged to me—I’d ‘uncle’ him!—There,
that petticoat’s all ready to proclaim
Cousin Jane’s thriftiness in clothing our dear
missionaries on the frontier. I’ll make them
for the sake of family peace: but I’m blessed
if I’ll take them to church to be packed: she
can escort her offering herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>April 10th.</span> Out on the porch again, in the
warm, sweet air, with all birddom for company.
Caro has gone driving with Bob White, after
wheeling me here for my own pleasure and
for the Peon’s astonishment when he comes
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The robins have a secret in the seven-trunked
maple. The leaves are so thick no
one could guess it except by their vigilance
in guarding the tree. They have made a law
that no jay, of any age, sex, or size, shall
alight in it, nor poke his bill among its
branches, nor brush it with his wings in flight;
and the law they have promulgated they are
ready to enforce. Dark and bloody tales are
told of jays—tales of cast-out eggs, of murdered
babies, and stolen nests; wherefore no
jay shall frequent that maple, “then, since
nor henceforward.” Hence, wild curiosity
among the jays, agitated caucuses in the pasture
oak, and unanimous decision to visit that
maple at all hazards, singly, and in groups.
They watch till the robins are at some distance,
and fly up to the tree on the far side, three
or four strong, while the robins, their backs
to their threatened castle, drag forth reluctant
worms by the middle. They seem absorbed in
their hunt, but they know! In the twinkling
of an eye they are at the maple, and no jay
may abide their coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor will the robins, after these aggressions,
tolerate the jays elsewhere. They may be
pecking at the foot of a tree when a jay alights
noiselessly in its topmost branch. They see,
apparently, through the top of their skulls;
and one jay or six, it is all the same to them.
They dash up with the <span class='it'>élan</span> of a picked regiment,
and again the jays shriek and fly. Not
a jay has pecked on this lawn this whole afternoon,
nor roosted while the robins pecked.
Time and again they have sallied in from the
pasture, and as often they have dashed
squawking back. It is a strenuous life for
the blue-coats: but it certainly keeps things
peaceful for the rest. The wood-thrushes have
ventured near today, and a pair of chippies
have come up on the porch, almost to my
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yesterday evening a dozen mocking-birds
were here on the lawn, singing singly, answering
one another, and joining again and
again in choruses that whelmed the grove in
melody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I lay in the growing twilight listening to
them and thinking once more of all that passes,
and of all that can never pass, when suddenly
through the closing dark came the wild, sweet
song of the wood-thrush, the first I had heard
this year: <span class='it'>U-o-lee! U-o-lee!</span> The three notes
form a perfect minor chord; and at their end
a sudden spray of rapid tinkling notes, and
the song again repeated, and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They say the thrushes have two sets of
vocal chords, long and short, and the double
vibration accounts for the splendid richness
of their tones. But when those wild, appealing
notes call through the gathering darkness
one thinks, not of anatomy, but of the <span class='it'>Sursum
Corda</span> in a church, and of all the souls who
shrink before some cup of suffering and yet
accept it, not merely with courage, but with
clear vision of the joy beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up from the brook the song came, and far
out on the road it was answered: <span class='it'>U-o-lee!
U-o-lee!</span> What magic fills the haunting notes
with subtle suggestions of human weakness,
of trembling courage, of faith no suffering
can slay? And when they ceased, the mocking-birds
took up the theme and carried it, far
into the moonlit night, to its inevitable and
triumphant conclusion—the song of the victor
on the heights who has conquered in the lowest
depths.</p>

<hr class='tbk130'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>April 19th.</span> Cousin Jane insisted on Caro’s
going to town with her yesterday, ostensibly
to do some shopping, but really, I think, to
give Bob White a chance to take them both to
lunch. Bob comes out pretty often, and is as
assiduous in his attentions as Caro will permit.
I cannot see that she especially favors either
him or David. She goes more with David,
but her attitude toward him is so frankly
affectionate that it is not as encouraging as
it might be. He meets her quite on her own
ground, and appears entirely satisfied. Everybody,
in fact, seems contented except Bob
White and Cousin Jane, to whom Bob pays
strenuous court. Caro went with her to town
with her usual light-hearted acquiescence in any
plan proposed. She takes life as it comes,
and makes a joyful occasion of the most commonplace
happenings. But before she would
agree to go she made Milly promise to come
and spend the day with me: and this morning
the two of them, with the Peon’s and David’s
assistance, escorted me out to the maple tree
in a triumphal procession, and established me
on a cot in the real outdoors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly scattered the crumbs for me, and sat
by my cot with her embroidery. I thought
the others were off for the station when Caro
came flying back, pinning her hat on as she
ran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mammy Lil, Milly needs some lessons in
ornithology. Prod some of the birds till they
chase the jay: and be sure you tell her what
turncoats the rice-birds are.” Her eyes danced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rice-birds?” I inquired stupidly.
“Why should I tell her about them? They’re
not here anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of them’s here,” she said gravely;
“I’ve seen him.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘<span class='it'>Robert of Lincoln is gaily dressed</span>’—</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Beware of bobolinks, Milly: they’re worse
than jabberwoks;” and she dabbed a little kiss
on the end of my nose and was off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly flushed to the roots of her hair, looking
at me shyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He and Caro are great friends,” she said;
“you know she’d never joke about him if she
didn’t like him. She calls him Reedbird, Rice-bird,
and Bobolink, and says that so many
<span class='it'>aliases</span> are sure proof of villainy. Sometimes
when she begins to discourse on birds before
Uncle Jason she scares me out of my wits.
But luckily he doesn’t know one bird from another,
except the ones that bother his crops.
To think how he has lived in the country, all
his life, and never seen anything in earth or
sky except crops and money! I do feel sorry
for him, Cousin Lil; but I can’t feel as sorry
as mother does, because I get so angry with
him. He’s—he’s insufferable sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you make him behave?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face paled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make him?” she repeated wonderingly.
“How on earth could anybody make Uncle
Jason do anything? Caro calls him jay-bird,
and that’s just what he is.—Look there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thrushes were actually breaking bread
with me this morning; and as Milly spoke a
jay dropped from his hiding-place overhead,
and managed to light on both of them at once
as they pecked peacefully side by side. They
dashed madly away and dropped under the
beech, panting, their breast-feathers bristling
with fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly was quite white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what he is like, even when you’re
trying so hard to please him,” she said. “I
can’t imagine what would happen if you opposed
him.” Her underlip quivered a little,
and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll show you what would happen if that
jay will just hang around here till a catbird
comes,” I said. “There are plenty of them
about, and a catbird stands no nonsense from
anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jay elected to remain. He chased
the cardinal, and tormented the thrushes till
they flew away to the brook. Then he perched
overhead, preened his feathers, and surveyed
the world with an air of impeccable virtue,—tyrant
and Pharisee in one. Presently, after
the fashion of his kind, he began to peer and
pry, leaning forward and thrusting his bill out
with an evident intention to stick it into the
business of the first neighbor who happened
in reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was just then that the catbird came for
his lunch. The jay perked his head eagerly,
thrust out his meddlesome beak, dropped to
the innocent’s back, and lit there with vicious
pecks. The catbird, panic-stricken, scrambled
out and dashed to the hackberry, while the
jay gobbled in true jay fashion, and I lay
feeling that Providence had slapped me in
the face—an overhasty conclusion, as our criticisms
of Providence frequently are. The catbird,
after due meditation, came back to the
maple, and delivered his opinion of the jay
in vitriolic language. The jay, scornfully unheeding,
flew to a neighboring limb, tucked
a big crumb under his toes, and proceeded to
eat it. The catbird returned to his lunch;
and when the jay dropped again, he hopped
sideways, turned, and faced his tormentor. He
spread out his wings and tail and began dancing
furiously up and down, as if he were set
on springs, not moving an inch from his place,
and uttering discordant cries. The jay gave
back amazedly. The catbird hopped a hop
nearer, resumed his dance, and repeated his
former remarks. The jay backed; the catbird
hopped nearer, and danced. The jay
dashed up against the maple trunk, where he
clung to the bark like a woodpecker, looking
down apprehensively, while the catbird continued
his dance and his deliverance on jay
manners. It was more than the bully’s nerves
could stand. In another moment he was off
to the pasture, and the catbird’s ruffled plumage
lay sleek again as he turned back to the
crumbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly was pale with excitement, her eyes
wide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think—” she breathed, and
paused, afraid of her own question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” I said confidently. “Just try
it awhile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But mother,” objected Milly; “you know
he’d take it out on her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t your mother going to stay with your
grandmother some time next month, while your
uncle and aunt take that trip North they’re
planning? Do it then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child was absolutely white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—oh, I couldn’t, Cousin Lil! If I began,
I’d be afraid to go on. He’d make me give in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother won’t go for several weeks,”
I said easily; “don’t look so frightened.
There’s nothing to be done today.—What a
pretty pattern that is you’re working; let me
see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sheered away from Cousin Jason, and
took up the subject of Robert Lincoln’s perfections,
which proved numerous. Then we had
lunch under the maple; and when the Peon
came home Milly went back.</p>

<hr class='tbk131'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>April 21st.</span> Caro telephoned me she would
stay all night at Cousin Jane’s, and did not
come home till yesterday noon. I was out
under the maple again, and watched her
through my glasses, as she drove in from the
pike in Cousin Jane’s buggy, with a small
darkey beside her to take the horse back.
The buggy was loaded with bundles, which
she toppled out on the grass beside me before
jumping after them herself. She sat on the
edge of the cot, and plunged into her tale
and her packages together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what took Cousin Jane up
to town, Mammy Lil? She’d seen an advertisement
of one of those cheap stores down on
Union Street about a sale of all-linen handkerchiefs
for three-and-a-half cents, only twelve
to a customer. And she traipsed all the way
to town to invest forty-two cents in handkerchiefs
for the missionary box—two for the mama
missionary and two each for the five kids.
Wouldn’t you just love, if you were a little
kid missionary, to have two whole three-and-a-half-cent
handkerchiefs of your very own—a
fresh one every week of the world? Mammy
Lil, sometimes I’m real fond of Cousin
Jane, cranky as she is, and sometimes I want
to slap her. But I didn’t: I just bought
some decent handkerchiefs, so they can use
Cousin Jane’s for window screens—they’re
coarse enough. Then Bob White turned up
and we went to lunch. They both pretended
it was an accident, but I don’t believe it; and
Cousin Jane frisked like a rhinocerous, and was
so pleased ‘over our little tête-a-tête,’ as she was
pleased to call our triangular lunch, that I
nearly died. And Bob was—no, it wasn’t
Bob; it was I. I was just cross. So I wasn’t
a bit nice—you know I really can be horrid,
Mammy Lil, when I put my mind to it. I’m
sorry; I’ll make it up to Bob next time I
see him; but Cousin Jane is such a donkey!
Goodness knows, though, I paid for that in
full!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke into rippling laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, she was just huffy—awfully. She’d
hardly speak to me; and I was in such a good
humor again! We’d gone back to the stores,
and I’d bought some lovely lawns—one for
you, and one for me, and one for Mrs. Missionary.
Let me show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She jerked a bundle out of the pile and displayed
her purchases, her head cocked meditatively
on one side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yours is lavender and mine pale green.
They’ll have lots of lace on them, and we’ll
both look ravishing. I got Mrs. Missionary
a blue. My instinct is that she’s sallow and
red-headed; so I resisted the blandishments
of a pink one that was two cents a yard
cheaper, and bought this. Cousin Jane says it
will fade. But that was after I pacified her:
she wouldn’t speak before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you manage it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I told her I was sorry I was cross—I
really was—and I said I’d go home with her
and make Cousin Chad one of those frozen
puddings. I didn’t dare offer to make it for
her, but she eats as much of it as he does,
which is saying a good deal. She softened
visibly; so we hurried for the first train, and
I worked like a black slave to get it done in
time. They ate like anything, and I let them
both give me good advice till bedtime; and
this morning I made the butter for her, and
we parted like twins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I laughed and patted her hand. She raised
one eyebrow and looked thoughtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cousin Jane and Cousin Chad think it’s
time I was married,” she observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a secondary consideration, though
important. But Cousin Jane was married at
sixteen. I’m already an old maid of twenty—or
will be next month; and if I go off in my
looks, I won’t find it so easy to go off matrimonially.
Besides, I’m flighty and bad tempered,
and a husband will be good discipline.
And Bob White is a very nice young man
who would probably put up with my temper
more than most. And he’s rich. And Cousin
Jane thinks if I try hard enough maybe I can
get him. What do you think of it, Mammy
Lil?” She pursed her mouth and frowned
judicially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think Jane Grackle’s a goose—and
you’re another,” I said, laughing. “There
comes David. Call him to wheel me back to
the porch.”</p>

<hr class='tbk132'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>April 29th.</span> Summer is coming everywhere.
The pasture fence is a long wall of bloom, and
the odor of honeysuckle fills the air. A wonderful
place for bird-babies that will be soon!
For ten days the roses have been blossoming,
and Uncle Milton’s flower-beds are beautiful
to see. And I—the earth isn’t the only dead
thing that rises into life! There’s another
miracle coming to pass: for I am getting
well!</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this month I’ve held my breath like a
coward, and turned my head, afraid to look
joy in the face. It has come near so often
before; and each time the pain has snatched
me back and bound me hand and foot. So
I said I would never inflict on myself the
agony of disappointment again. But I just
can’t live up to that foolishness, and I’m so
glad I can’t. If this isn’t the ending, but just
a blossoming oasis in a desert way, shall I
miss the joy of that? It’s nearer the end than
the last one was, anyway, and better and
brighter and bigger. If it isn’t fulfillment, it is
prophecy, and that’s the next best thing. Some
day it will come—the Head said so. I am
to be part of life again—I! I! Some day I
shall go in and out again among my kind, with
power enough of living in me to make hours
atone for days, and months for years. Nothing
shall pass me that is mine! It is human
life I want, not birds and trees and flowers:
they’re beautiful, but they aren’t enough—I
can afford to let myself say it now, because
the other is so near, so near! I used to be
part of life here, long, long after I was sick:
there was nothing I couldn’t help about, nobody
who didn’t smile at me as I passed: in
every face I saw a memory of kindness given
and received. And I’m going back to it, to
my real life.—Ah, soon or late, what matter?
<span class='it'>I’m going back!</span> Though a thousand downfalls
be in the way, I’ll make it yet: and be
this fulfilment, or only prophecy, I open my
heart to joy!</p>

<div><h1><a id='bbird'></a>VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='sc'>Blackbird Diplomacy</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 9th.</span> Something is dreadfully wrong
with Caro, and for once she does not give me
her confidence. She went to Milly’s night
before last quite her own bright self, and came
back to lunch yesterday another creature. A
shower came up just after lunch, so I lay on
my porch sofa until it passed, with David and
Caro for company. I imagine things had gone
wrong at the table. I saw, by Caro’s bright
color and the high way she carried her pretty
head when she came home, that trouble was
brewing for somebody, and she probably found
David’s sunny and unsuspicious good humor
the negative complement of her own surcharged
spirit. There had been at least a minor
explosion; for when they came out to me they
were both making an effort to appear quite like
themselves. But Caro’s eyes were danger-signals;
and, though David smiled and his voice
had its usual deep evenness, his eyes kept a furtive
and brooding watch on hers. She seemed in
the gayest of spirits, yet there was some jangle
in the mirth which had always rung sweet and
true before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thunder was rattling overhead, and the
wind-blown curtains of the rain shut out the
hills beyond. David walked to the end of the
porch and studied the clouds for a little before
he came back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was afraid this storm would spoil the
drive you promised me yesterday,—” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not resort to the weather as
an excuse,” she said, “I don’t want to go
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>David stared, and a slow color burned under
his tanned skin. Then he looked half-amused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Caro must have been having some kind
of an extra tilt with Cousin Jason, Mammy
Lil,” he said, “and she thinks I’m an old jay,
too, and keeps ruffling her feathers at me.—I
was about to say that the sun would be out
inside of an hour, and by five o’clock the roads
will be in the pink of condition. I’ll show
you what Peggy can really do in the way of
speed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you I don’t want to go,” said Caro,
angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg pardon,” said David easily; “you
told me you would go. I couldn’t possibly be
mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was looking at Caro in open-eyed amazement.
She had never spoken to David that
way in her life—nor to any one since she had
ceased to be a child. She caught my look,
and colored deeply. Then she cuddled her
face against mine so that neither David nor I
could see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Mammy Lil, don’t look as if you
didn’t know me,” she said, with a sudden little
catch in her voice; “I’ve always told you I’m
hateful, and you won’t believe it; when I convince
you, don’t quit loving me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You silly child,” I answered, patting the
red-brown coil of curls; “I’ll never quit loving
you, whether I’m dead or alive. But I was
afraid you weren’t well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed and pecked my cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m well as ever was.—Have Peggy ready,
David: I’d like to go sixty miles an hour.—Oh,
dear, I’m losing all my hairpins!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wasn’t at all. But she caught her hair
with both hands, and vanished through one of
the long windows. David looked after her
with the set look which I had learned to know
when he was little more than a baby. Then
he, too, kissed me, and walked away, after putting
the stand with my bell and a plate of
biscuits on it close beside me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I lay there puzzled and troubled. The rain
stopped presently, and I crumbled the biscuits
and flung them out on the grass, watching the
birds idly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Promptly at five David drove round with
Peggy, his favorite mare, her beautiful head
held as high as Caro’s own, and as free from
torments of check-rein and blinders. She shone
like satin, and stepped with a proud consciousness
of her own worth and her master’s confidence
in her. David sat chatting with me during
the ten minutes Caro kept him waiting. She
had on the pale green lawn when she came out,
and a most fetching hat which she had herself
concocted to go with it. I beheld her adornment
with dismay. The lawn was more lace
than lawn, and I knew she had planned it for
what she called a “partyfied” dress. She
usually went driving with David bareheaded,
and in whatever garments she happened to have
on. Her finery boded him no good; and I
realized with a sinking heart that if I had had
the wit to keep my astonishment out of my face
she would have stuck to her first refusal, and
the drive would have been postponed to a more
auspicious day. David was riding to disaster—and
I had opened the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was almost dark when they came home,
and I had been back in bed for some time.
Caro came in looking distractingly pretty, and
sweeter than a naughty child should. I knew
by the lavish bounty of her caresses that she
had treated David very badly indeed, and
was torn between a desire to take her in my
arms and get the whole story out of her, and
a wish to set her in the corner till she should
return to her normal state of mind. But I
remembered what I had promised David
months ago, and repressed my itch to meddle.
She had always confided in me before, and unless
she did now I must be dumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David, I did not see until morning. He
had brought Caro home and had returned at
once to Chatterton, sending me word he had
an engagement and would not be at home until
after I was asleep. It was after midnight when
I heard him come in. This morning he came
to my room as usual, but his eyes looked as
if he had not slept. I pretended to see nothing,
because he wished it.—But what had happened
to Caro? If she had been at Cousin
Jane’s I might have suspected some mischief-making;
but she went only to Grace’s. Whatever
caused the change, it goes deep. She has
been in her own room all day, and I have
not even heard her sing.</p>

<hr class='tbk133'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 12th.</span> Caro has left us and gone to
Cousin Jane’s—gone there to live. She went
day before yesterday, and I have felt too stunned
to think.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stayed in her room all day, except at
lunch time, and came out late in the afternoon,
looking white and tired, but with that same
danger signal in her eyes. I was under the
maple, and she sat on the stool beside my cot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mammy Lil,” she began, with a forced
lightness, as though she spoke only of trifles,
“I’ve been packing my traps today. You’re
so much better now, you don’t really need me
all the time, and I think I ought to go to
Cousin Jane. Cousin Chad’s my real guardian,
you know; and they’ve been awfully good
about lending me to you when you were so
sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt blinded at first by the blow. “Lending”
me Caro—when she had never stayed a
whole month together away from me since she
was seven years old, except for the years at
boarding school! My head swam, and there
was such a roaring in my ears I couldn’t hear
all she said. She wasn’t looking at me, but
her voice went on with the foolish words, till
I pulled myself together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Cousin Jane been trying to make you
think it’s your duty to go and wait on her,
Caro, after you’ve grown up in this, your real
home? She doesn’t need you, child; there’s
no call for such a sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She hasn’t said a word about needing me,”
protested Caro. “I just think I ought to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure—forgive me, dearie—but
do you really think she wants you there to
live—for always?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I telephoned her this morning. I’m sure
she’s delighted. She does love me,—only it’s
in her queer way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Caro—” I said, and stopped. We had
lived in her and for her so many years. I
could not suggest that she owed us anything.
The tears came to my eyes, but I held them
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear,” I went on, “I’ve never tried to
force your confidence, and I can’t now. Something
is wrong, I know—some trifle, probably,
that a little honest frankness would set right.
But I know when we are young we come to a
place where we must manage our own affairs,
no matter how we bungle them or how
many hearts we break; it’s the way we all learn
at times. But darling, remember that my love
waits to help you, if you ever want its service.
And, whatever you do, Caro, don’t do it in
anger like a child. It is the mark of a woman
to walk in love, and to serve love only, even
where she must give the deepest hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat looking across the hills, only her
profile toward me, but I saw her lip quiver.
She dropped her head on my shoulder and
snuggled her face under my chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the sweetest mammy! You know
I love you—more than ever I did in my life.
And I’m coming to see you so often you’ll
think I’m living here. But I’m sure I ought to
go. There’s the buggy now; Cousin Jane said
she’d send it over. My trunk is all ready; she’ll
send for that, too. I thought I’d rather you’d
tell Daddy Jack and David good-bye for me.
Won’t you let me take you back to the house
first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I said; “David will help me, and
your Daddy Jack. It isn’t time yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught her breath a little, kissed me
with a sorry effort at playfulness, and went
towards the buggy. I watched it driving
out the gate to the pike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither David nor the Peon came, and after
awhile Josie came out to say that “Mr. John”
had telephoned he would have to spend the
night in the city. She wheeled me to the
porch, and I was back in bed before David
came in. I was thankful for once that the
Peon was away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David went to his solitary dinner, and then
sat by me in the twilight, stroking my hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What struck Caro to go off again?” he
asked, in a tone he tried hard to make casual.
“Josie says she told her she was off for a
visit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She went to Cousin Jane’s—went to stay,
I mean. She’ll change her mind in a few days,
I suppose. She has been upset for a day or
two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Cousin Jane’s—to stay?” he repeated
in bewilderment. “And left you here—like
this?” he added in indignant unbelief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, something drove her. She’s unhappy
about something—there’s some mistake:
and the need to keep it to herself is on
her. It makes me feel—oh, Davy, boy, I’ve
always thought I was a real mother to you
children; but I’m only the best substitute for
a mother you’ve known. If I were truly
Caro’s mother—if I had done all I thought
I was doing—the child would have told me.
You are both suffering for nothing—because
I failed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent his cheek to mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve never failed in anything, sweetest
mother in the world. And Caro loves you
just as I do—I’d swear it. Sometimes you
can’t help hurting the people you love best.
I—I’m hurting you myself; and I can’t help
it. I’d give my right hand to help it; but I
can’t—yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no need, Davy, dear,” I said
steadily, glad that the dark had fallen to curtain
my eyes. “Don’t try to be anything
with me, or to say anything, but what is natural
and right to you. The one thing I couldn’t
get over, dear, would be your playing a part
with me. I understand; and I can wait—a
life-time, if you wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed my hand, and sat there till the
moon rose over the eastern hills and strewed
the lawn with shadows. A mocking-bird stirred
in his sleep and sang softly to himself. I
could not speak. I lay straining my eyes
through the dark to see his face, but it was
all in the shadow. He rose to go at last, and,
before I knew it, unbidden words had risen
from some subconscious depth and uttered
themselves through my lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“David,” I said, with a sudden, foolish up-lift
of my heart, “I’m going to be walking
all about by Thanksgiving; and before the
year is out I will help with my own hands to
decorate this house for your and Caro’s wedding.
I don’t know how I know it; but I do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen,” said David solemnly. “Mammy
Lil, you’re a corker when it comes to prophesying.
Keep up the habit; it’s sure comforting;
and you always could see further
through a stone wall than anybody else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had—or feigned—more faith in my
prophecy than I had myself. I felt like a
fool who has published his folly to the world.
And as I lay there, tearless and sleepless the
long night through, I had no hope for David,
and only a dull anguish at thought of the
girl I had called my daughter so long.</p>

<hr class='tbk134'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 13th.</span> The world is all in a mist this
morning as the sky blossoms above the eastern
hills. The wren sings first, bringing the tears
for which my lids have burned all night. A
cardinal calls somewhere—<span class='it'>Cheer! Cheer!</span>—no,
it is a mocking-bird, for his own notes bubble
out after his cardinal call, before he wanders
into a thrasher’s song, repeating his notes as
carefully as “the wise thrush” himself. There
he is, on the topmost twig of that mist-dimmed
oak. He has tuned his voice to the oriole’s
carol now, but again his own notes bubble
through. Now he scolds like an angry
wren, following the tirade with harsh cries
and the blackbird’s censorious <span class='it'>tsck!</span> Then he
slips into a catbird melody—a jumble of music,
jeering, and captious squawks. Gradually
the music overflows all else. Clearer and
sweeter grow the notes, slow, soft, and wondrous
pure. His head is thrown up in rapture
while the flood of melody rises and swells till
it sweeps him bodily into air. He opens his
mist-gray wings and tail, spreading to the light
the gleaming white of the in-folded feathers,
and rises through the vapors to clearer air,
singing as one to whom all mists are crystal
clearness, all darkness as the light. He trembles
at the height an instant, poised above
the vapor-shrouded earth, while his song floats
upward to the heaven of which it speaks,—a
blending of calm and rapture, of aspiration and
peace. Back to his perch he falls, still singing,
content with earth as with heaven, and rises
once again, to poise an instant, to fall, to rise,
again and yet again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the Song of the Open Vision. Haunting,
appealing, alluring, the rapturous notes
search the listener’s heart to draw response
from every memory of mist-drenched darkness
dissolved in growing light.</p>

<hr class='tbk135'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 14th.</span> The Peon is the comfort of my
life. I dreaded telling him about Caro, and
behold, he knew all about it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cousin Chad had been in town and came out
on the same train with him yesterday afternoon.
He couldn’t refrain from crowing a
little about Caro and his dear Jane—so capable
and sensible, so equal to every emergency.
And it was her doing, after all: I know she
never intended for me to know it. But she
met Caro in the road on her way back from
Grace’s that day, and made the child go by
home with her. Then she—to quote Cousin
Chad—“was able to make her see the indelicacy
of her establishing herself in the same
house with a young man whom gossips were
accusing her of trying to capture!” The Peon
at this point expressed polite dissent from
Cousin Chad’s approval of his wife’s tactful
performance; and my pious relative waxed
righteously indignant, and assumed the air of
a protector of the defenceless orphan. Whereupon
the Peon took refuge in his paper and
Cousin Chad simmered in that condemnatory
silence of his which always seemed to me worse
than any possible swear-words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Peon doesn’t feel at all upset about
Caro and David; the only thing that troubles
him is that I should be left alone again during
the day. So far as David is concerned, the
Peon thinks Caro would never have gone if
she hadn’t cared for him, to some extent, at
least, in the way Cousin Jane accused her of
doing—which is certainly reasonable enough.
And as to her loving David and yet treating
him as I’m sure she did, the Peon begs
me to remember some rather cold-blooded
performances of my own in our courting
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember the night after Jessie
Martin’s wedding?” he demanded. “After
that night, and your marrying me six
months later, I lost my faith in a girl’s ‘no.’
If I had it to go over again, I’d not lose a
night’s sleep on account of it, my lady: and so
I told David as he drove me home from the
station.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you told him, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did. And I told him to give Caro plenty
of rope, and your Cousin Jane would soon
hang herself with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much of anything. He seems to think
Mrs. Grackle only furnished the occasion for
Caro’s real feeling toward him to come to the
front. He’s pretty sore, I imagine. But don’t
you worry your dear head. Lovers would miss
half the fun of the game if they couldn’t be
drowned in misery now and then. Just let
them alone and let them get all that’s coming
to them. They’ll work through it somehow, and
straighten it out to their perfect satisfaction
when they get ready—and not before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You didn’t let it alone,” I said reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said; “that’s why I’m so well
posted about the course to pursue. I’ve done
all that’s necessary myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes laughed a little, and I laughed
back. Maybe I was a true prophet after all.
Anyway, I musn’t look like a graveyard just
because we’re all lonesome, and David is so
quiet as he comes and goes. And if I’m not
to look like a graveyard, the best way is not
to feel like one.</p>

<hr class='tbk136'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 17th.</span> Things are happening so fast
they make my head swim. David is gone, too;
and I feel like an old hen who has raised a
pair of wild geese and seen them go flying
out of sight in opposite directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fixed it all with the Peon before he said
a word to me. Then he sat by my cot, with
those coaxing ways of his—I knew some kind
of a wrench was coming. He wanted to go
out to Washington and take charge of the
Peon’s apple orchard there and finish planting
the land. He’d been thinking of it for some
time. The only reason he hesitated about going
was the leaving me alone: but I needed Caro
more than I needed him; and if he went—.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But oh, my dear, I don’t!” I cried. “You
are my first, my best of children! And as
for having Caro—I’ll have her when the time
comes of which I told you the other night. I
don’t want her before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’d rather I wouldn’t go?” he
asked, trying to keep the disappointment out
of his voice. “You’ve had such an awful pull,
little mother, and been so brave about it: and
I know Caro and I helped to drain the life
out of you before you went away. I’ll stay
if you want me to.” He bent his head above
my hand, and I saw his mouth was set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d not hold you a minute, boy,” I said;
“distance can’t separate us. I’ve never been
separated from you yet, and never will be
while you love me. It isn’t your being near
me that I want: it’s your emancipation,
through life, into freedom of life. The more
living you do, the closer we’ll come together,
though the living be done on the other side
of the globe. When would you like to start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tonight?” he said, inquiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tonight,” I answered. “And the farm
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Milton knows what to do. And
I’ve made Uncle Jack a schedule to follow.
It will be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re going for how long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forever and a day. Tell Caro so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” I said, “I’ll tell Caro forever
and a day. But what shall I tell this
old lady who loves you so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell her I’ll come at the drop of a hat
or the click of a telegraph, day or night, whenever
she wants me—forever and a day. And
Mammy Lil—what’s the use of talking? You
understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed his head up under my hand as
a signal that one of the rare pettings was in
order: and presently he picked me up in his
strong arms and carried me to his room, where
I lay on the bed and watched him pack his
trunk in utter defiance of all known principles
of the art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found some comfort in doing it, too.
His face shows care and lack of sleep, but
he whistled a bit as he dropped his shooting
boots on the bosom of a shirt, and made a
soft place for the butt of his gun with a felt
hat. He isn’t entirely hopeless about the outcome,
no matter how miserable he is: it is
poor little Caro who will get the heaviest end
of the mischief Cousin Jane’s meddling has
produced. And that thick-headed, thick-skinned
old Pharisee will go scot free herself. Oh,
dear! I’d like to be good! But it is such a
strenuous undertaking with Cousin Jane in the
family: St. John himself couldn’t manage it;
and I never was cut out for a saint.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 20th.</span> Caro did not come back until
yesterday, though she called the Peon up daily
to ask how I was and to send her love. She
did not allude to David, and the Peon volunteered
no information. But yesterday she
dashed in at the gate, driving like a young
Jehu, flung the reins to Uncle Milton, who
was at work among the roses at the other end
of the house, and came flying across the lawn
to my cot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mammy Lil, are you all alone? Has
David really gone—to stay, I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told her his plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat on the edge of the cot, her head
held high, her eyes sparkling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a shame!” she exclaimed indignantly;
“how could he have the heart to leave you
so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked at her quizzically. I had been
feeling rather forlorn; but suddenly the comical
side of my woes presented itself, as it so
kindly and so often does, and I wanted to
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who ran first?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flushed to the roots of her curly hair
and slipped to the grass beside me, her pretty
head on my shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re pigs, both of us,” she averred contritely.
“But, Mammy Lil, David is the worst
pig. He really could have stayed: and I—couldn’t.
Anyway, I’m glad he’s gone; it’s
just about the decentest thing he’s done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a consistent child,” I observed,
stroking her hair; “but, Caro dear, I’m not
accustomed to hearing David criticized from
the standpoint of decency, and we won’t begin
now. And I wanted him to go very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyway, I can come back. I’ll never
leave you here by yourself. I’ll go back and
pack up this evening, and come home first
thing in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shook my head. I had been thinking
about it all these long, lonesome days. They
are both my children, but David has the first
right to our home; and with Caro installed
here he will not come back to it. Besides, it
isn’t fair. And if they will fight at cross-purposes
we must all take the consequences together.
I know I am rather a dishevelled shuttle-cock
to do duty between their clashing
wills; but they will have to have it out, now
that they have begun it. And if that hard-hearted
little sinner came back here, she’d convince
herself in no time that David is the sinner
and she is the one and only saint. It never did
take long for staying at Cousin Jane’s to pall
on Caro; and she’ll probably see things from
various points of view before she concludes her
experiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor little soul, she cried dreadfully. She
even tried to work on my sympathies by telling
me how Cousin Jane serves up Bob White’s
perfections morning, noon, and night. This
was welcome news to me, and helped me to
disguise the very fluid condition of my supposedly
hard heart. I must confess we both
cried before she went back: but Caro owned it
was fair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I feel like a yellow dog, of course. One
always does when one stands for a painful
justice—it’s part of the job. I felt the same
shame when she was a little thing and I let her
bite the red pepper she snatched in the garden
the minute I told her not to touch it. It burns
my own mouth to this day. But Caro never
snatched against orders again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there’s no sense in listening to
Grumpy’s prophecies. Where is the pleasure
of growing old if one can’t learn to distil from
one’s experiences the essential oil of hope?
When the Peon and I fell out, hopelessly,
desperately, eternally, about six months before
we were married, I was just a young thing,
and quite pardonable in my belief that my
life was ruined forever by the cataclysm. But
from the vantage-ground of twenty-odd years
of additional living I should be able to detect
the flimsiness of the average impenetrable barrier.
I don’t think Caro cares for any one
else, at least; and if they’re not meddled with
they’ll work it out their own way, which must
be the best way for the Peon and me. And
if he and I can’t enjoy ourselves very much
just now, why, we don’t want to when the
children are miserable; so that’s all right, of
course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to their misery, I have at least come
far enough in life myself to know that it has—or
will have—its mitigations. I never yet
have been in a hole—and heaven knows life
has been a procession of holes these last years—that
I didn’t get out of it with some added
capacity of living that made being in holes
worth while. Why should I begrudge the
children their own hole-adventures and discoveries,
their own enrichment of life?</p>

<hr class='tbk137'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 22nd.</span> The Peon comes home early
these days and takes me out for a ride. I
can sit in my chair or lie down at will; and
he wheels me over the soft grass to all the
places I’ve been longing to see and have only
beheld in Make-Believe. We go down to the
brook nearly every day about sunset and watch
the birds quenching their thirst before bedtime.
There are many song sparrows down there;
and the killdeers haunt the banks at all time,
whirring up when startled with wild cries, their
breasts and lifted wings flashing snow-white
beneath, and the rich salmon of the lower back
gleaming as they rise from the valley into the
level sunlight along the brow of the hill. The
Peon flattens my chair to a couch, and throws
himself on the grass or sits on the roots of a
sycamore, while we talk of all the years that
the children have been growing up with us,
and of what the future is to bring. We are
both very strenuously cheerful. And indeed,
in our hearts, we do hope honestly to have them
both at home again some day. Only it seems
rather a long way off sometimes; and the
house is so very quiet when we go back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes we go back to the spot we picked
out years ago as the one where we thought
David might like to build his home some day;
for though we always hoped to have him with
us, we never wanted to rob him of a home of
his own. We had never said to one another
that we hoped for Caro to make the home for
him—to put it into words seemed to infringe
on their right to settle that great matter, each
to their own heart’s wish: but we had hoped
it without words. We go there now, and hope
for it openly, bridging our separation with
happy dreams, and comforting one another
with assurances it is not always easy to feel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David has not been long enough at his
journey’s end for a letter mailed there to reach
us; but it seems as if he had been gone for
months. And poor little Caro looks so wistful
when she starts back to Cousin Jane’s
that I feel as though I have been turning
her out of doors for the most of my life. It
is really not to be borne very much longer.
The Peon’s sister wants us to go to her next
month, at her summer home in the mountains
of Pennsylvania; and Caro will have to come
home in time to get me ready. We can spend
the summer together, at least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before I go I want to see plainer sailing
for Milly and Bobolink, as Caro disrespectfully
styles Mr. Lincoln. Grace was here for
a little while today to tell me good-bye. She
is off to stay with George’s mother while the
old lady’s daughter takes a trip. Milly was
with her, and promised to come back soon. She
said she wanted to talk to me, and from the
anxious air with which she said it, I’m hoping
she is seriously thinking of turning on that
jay-bird uncle of hers and teaching him a few
of the things he needs to learn.</p>

<hr class='tbk138'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 25th.</span> A golden day, after a night of
drenching rain. The sky is like October, and
under it the winds are at play. And why,
when sunshine fills the world, should one suffer
one’s eyes to be blinded to it by any mote of
pain or trouble held close enough to shut out
all the light? I will keep mine at arm’s length,
if I die for it, and see around it and over it,
yes, and through it, into this beautiful, wonderful
world! If one’s feet can’t travel, aren’t
one’s eyes an open road of escape?</p>

<hr class='tbk139'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 27th.</span> Three sleepless nights, a dead
weight of weariness, loneliness to the heart’s
core, and pain that wrings the flesh—these
are among Grumpy’s stock-in-trade this morning,
and he flaunts them and a dozen other
things, wherever I turn my thoughts. He
has heaped up, mountain high, the things I
want and can’t have; and there he sits, grinning
at the void they leave in my idle, useless
life. I must fill that hole, or go under. What
have I left?</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, the Peon’s love, and the children’s,
and that of my friends. Love: and the Love
from which love came. By the time all that is
stowed away in the void, it has rather a “gone”
look about it—for a void. And Grumpy’s
grin has a tuck in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a sense of humor—the most blessed
thing, save love itself, ever given to human
kind. It keeps one sane and balanced where
without it one would go mad. A source of
justice it is, a bond of sympathy, a destroyer
of egotism, a solace in suffering, a staff to
courage, an open door of escape from all that
is unbearable in life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next, the power to hold my tongue when
things hurt, and to keep the whine out of my
voice when I’m nothing but whine inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are love, laughter, and silence; and as
void-fillers they go a long way. But there are
other things for the chinks. For I can read
a little and write a little, and think a little,
as against the black idleness of those three
years. And beauty—wind in the tree-tops, the
arching blue, the flicker of light and shade—beauty
everywhere, in fact; and back of beauty
the Thought that designed both it and the
eyes to see it. Oh, it is a beautiful world!
And though one’s body lies idle, one’s thoughts
may go everywhere, and are everywhere at
home. And may not endurance itself, however
passive, yet rise to the point of achievement,
if only one endure in the right way?
And if liberty be measured by one’s capacity
to do without—oh, how can any walls of suffering
shut one in when the way up is always
open—up, to the presence of God?</p>

<hr class='tbk140'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 28th.</span> Whenever I think I’ve overcome
a temptation, and can afford to rest,
something else comes pouncing and catches me
napping. This time it was Cousin Jane. I’m
not a bit sorry I sent her home—it was high
time for her to go. But I needn’t have been
so blazing mad when I did it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hasn’t been near me for ages, but she
came at last, exactly when she very specially
should have kept away. So as I lay there on
the porch sofa—for I couldn’t get out in the
yard this week—I heard the familiar pile-driver
tread, and opened my eyes to behold her
at the corner of the porch, personified virtue,
somewhat overheated by the afternoon sun,
and looking rather limp about the collar. But
there was nothing limp about her stolid mouth,
nor in her hard black eyes. She had come for
a purpose, and was not displeased to think I
wouldn’t enjoy it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’ve been afraid of Cousin Jane all my life.
I used to run at the sound of her voice when
I was a child at Cedarhurst. More than once
I have been gently, but firmly, extracted from
a closet by Great-aunt Letitia, and led to her
presence to perform the rites required by politeness
to even the most unpleasant kin. Somehow
it all came back to me—the childish, unreasoning
fear. I was so weak, the pain so
biting sharp; I could not bear unkindness, too.
I turned my head toward the long windows
with a wild thought of escape; but when my
heart is like this, I can scarcely walk, and I
could never have reached my room. Besides,
she would come after me: so I made a virtue
of necessity and lifted my hand. She saved
me the trouble of speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good land alive, Lyddy! Are you mopin’
around yet, makin’ out like you’re half dead?
I wonder John Bird doesn’t go crazy! I heard
you were rompin’ all over the place, throwin’
the birds enough biscuit to feed all the poor
folks in town, if you only had religion enough
to think about them instead of your own silly
whims.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came close and settled herself heavily
in the Peon’s chair, waving her fan vigorously.
She reached across me to the stand on the
other side, and rang my bell sharply. Josie
appeared at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go draw me some fresh water, straight
out of the well,” she commanded. It was
one of her hobbies to ignore the Peon’s water
system, and to assume that we depended on
a well and a windlass, as she boasted that she
still did herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you rather have a glass of lemonade?”
I inquired. “And bring some wafers,
Josie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Josie’s mother makes wonderful old-time
wafers, as thin as paper and as crisp as frosty
air. They are beautifully rolled, and melt in
one’s mouth: no other cook in the county can
achieve them. Cousin Jane ate the entire
plateful, and her manner, as she turned to me
once more, was a shade less like that of a
regiment charging a redoubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did David go off for?” she demanded.
“Have you and John Bird turned
him loose? I can’t get a thing out of Caroline,
and I know something’s wrong somewhere.
What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He went to look after some business,” I
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you can tell that to the neighbors that
ain’t kin,” she said scornfully. “I want to
know what’s wrong. He’s done somethin’, I
know, an’ Caroline’s ashamed of it. I can’t
get a thing out of her, but she’s a changed
girl. An’ more than that, she’s standin’ in
her own light. She’s that flighty an’ cross
Bob White looks like he don’t know what to
make of it. Men ain’t goin’ to stand too
much foolishness, an’ first news you know,
Caroline can’t get him if she wants him. I’m
talkin’ plain, but it’s time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you talk to Caro?” I suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good land, Lyddy, do you reckon I ain’t?
But it’s like water on a duck’s back—in one
ear and out the other. An’ besides”—with a
sudden deep craft in her beady eyes—“you
have to be careful with girls—at least, a person
with tact does. I don’t come right out with
things to Caroline, like you would. But I
just thought I’d get together all the things
David’s been doin’ an’ lay ’em before her. I
don’t suppose you let her know the half of it,
whatever it was. Was it somethin’ about
money, or has he been getting into fast ways,
drinkin’, or playin’ cards, or—worse? I always
knew he would get into mischief sooner or
later—he pretends to be so steady: I’ve just
been waitin’ for it to come. Why, what’s
the matter, Lyddy? What do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat straight up and rang the bell. Josie
ran out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get me my chair, Josie, quick,” I said.
She whirled it to my side, and I stepped in
unaided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take me to my room,” I told her, “and
leave me there while you tell Uncle Milton
to get Mrs. Grackle’s buggy and to open the
gate for her. She is going home at once.
Then come back and help me to bed. Do
not come back until I send for you, Cousin
Jane: I am not well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at me, speechless and apoplectic,
and as Josie arranged my pillows I saw
her driving between the cedars. And above
all my anger about David and my consciousness
that Great-aunt Letitia would be ashamed
of me, above the weakness, and above the tearing,
throbbing pain, is the exhilaration of
knowing that for once in my life I wasn’t
afraid of Cousin Jane. I never will be afraid
of her again!</p>

<hr class='tbk141'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>May 31st.</span> Trying all one’s life to see things
from other peoples’ point of view has this advantage
in sickness: it helps one to stand apart
from the suffering and to look at it from
without, even when whelmed in it, and almost
overwhelmed. One sees it as if it were someone
else’s sickness, taking the long view of it,
as a doctor does. He is sorry for the pain, of
course; he knows it is bad. But he expects
it. And he expects the backsets, and the blues,
and the can-I-ever-get-wells, and all the rest
of it. Those things are part of the process of
recovery, and do not affect the final outcome.
Once past a certain point, the road leads
inevitably to one sure goal; the windings in
and out don’t count, nor the ups and downs;
one is advancing all the time. Now, if a doctor,
who doesn’t need it, can get that comfort out
of my aches and pains, why shouldn’t I get
it, who need it so much?</p>

<hr class='tbk142'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>June 1st.</span> Out under the maple again today,
and the stars in their courses fighting for me!
And why, when a miracle like this happens
for Milly and Bobolink, should I despair of
David and Caro?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly came to see me to have that long
talk she spoke about. She had been telephoning
every day to know when she could come,
so I had Josie call her the moment I found
I could go out. And just suppose I had been
well enough yesterday—what a misfortune
that would have been!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She scattered the crumbs for me, and settled
beside me to pour out what Caro calls
“her uncle-ish woes;” and while she was doing
it, the wood-thrush flew down, only to be
shouldered away from the feast by a mannerless
jay. Somehow it made me feel perfectly
hopeless about Milly, poor little soft, sweet
thing, and my eyes filled up with tears; but
when I had winked them dry, the thrush went
back. The jay pecked at him savagely, and
he dashed half-way round the hydrangeas in
terror. Milly saw him and caught her breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Jason <span class='it'>is</span> like that,” she said, with
a little catch in her voice; “and I can’t stand
against him—I can’t! Don’t you see how helpless
the thrush is, Cousin Lil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the thrush had stopped in mid-flight.
His breast was puffed out like a tiny balloon,
the trembling of his legs plain to be seen;
he quivered from head to foot. But he turned
slowly, his legs shaking under him, and hopped
deliberately toward his tormentor, his head
high, his swollen breast making a ruff of feathers
visible on either side of his back. He went
close to the jay and pecked toward him in
the air. The jay, startled, gave back an inch.
The thrush, still trembling, hopped nearer and
pecked, as steadily as if his legs were in their
normal condition. The bully backed again.
The thrush hopped and pecked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly had leaned forward, her hand on mine.
Her face was white and she was breathing
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jay continued to back. The wood-thrush
followed him, inch by inch, unyielding,
yet in mortal fear. At last the big coward
could stand it no longer. He spread his wings
and vanished across the brook. The thrush
stood trembling a moment, his feathers slowly
flattening along his sides, and then returned
quietly to his lunch. Milly rose, a new light
in her soft eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he can, I can,” she said steadily. “I
don’t need to talk any more, Cousin Lil: I’m
going home and <span class='it'>do</span>.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='rout'></a>X<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='sc'>The Routing of Uncle Jason</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>June 2nd.</span> I’m afraid I haven’t inherited
the family grace of hospitality; for the further
I get from Cousin Jane’s visit the more glad
I am that I sent her home. And it isn’t all on
David’s account either, though I could never
have done it but for what she said of him. Yet
since it is done I remember her life-time disregard
of the small courtesies of life. I wonder
if it were not more cowardice in me than
kindness that for so long I meekly allowed
it, and thereby encouraged her, so far as lay
in my power, to ride rough-shod over all the
rules of politeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do believe that decent manners, even to
one’s junior kinfolks, are an essential part of
decent morals; one can commit as dastardly
crimes with an ill-tempered tongue as with
a lying one. And what right has she to plume
herself on her frankness, as if that were a
justification for such ill manners as cut the
joy and fellowship of life at the root? I think
our ideas of morals need standardizing, at
least to the point where we can no longer, by
bad temper and worse behavior, inflict misery
at will on those about us, sowing on every
side the seeds of anger or contempt, and yet
remain a highly respected member of society
and a shining light in the church.—Yet, after
all, I’m making a deal of a pother about trifles.
It is what we do ourselves that counts, not
what is done to us. In the face of the void,
at the land’s end, the hurts one has suffered
will disappear; it is the hurts one has inflicted
that will be lions in the way. And if I have
really hurt Cousin Jane—well, when I’m a
little stronger I’ll try my best to get straight
with her. For the present, I am here in bed
again, with the birds outside for company—and
a visit from Caro to look forward to. She
telephoned a while ago that she had been
spending the night with Milly and would be
over before lunch. So Cousin Jason hasn’t
annihilated the child, at least.</p>

<hr class='tbk143'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>June 3rd.</span> Milly really did go home and
begin. She went by for Caro yesterday afternoon
on her way home, and they found Cousin
Jason in a thunderous mood. Milly was quietly
determined. He had left the breakfast
table that morning in a temper, after his
frequent fashion: and Milly, in her brand-new
fashion, had refrained from running after
him and imploring him to have pity on his
poor head, and drink his coffee. He had fumed
around on the porches for some time, waiting
for her to take her cue, and had finally disappeared.
He came back at eleven with a
headache, slamming all the doors, notwithstanding,
and demanded hot coffee at once.
Milly, however, had forseen this contingency
and prepared for it. The cook’s daughter was
ill, and she had allowed her to go down there
as soon as breakfast was over and stay until
time to cook dinner. It was the housemaid’s
regular day off, and she had already departed,
not to return until the late afternoon. As
Uncle Jason had ordered cold lunches for the
summer, the girl had fixed everything for him,
and left it in the refrigerator. Joe, the house
man, would serve it. Milly herself, who was
just leaving the house as her uncle came in,
had an engagement in Chatterton for lunch
and must hurry; but if he wanted coffee Joe
could make a fire for him, though he could
not brew any drinkable beverage. But Uncle
Jason had always said he could make better
coffee than her mother’s cooks, and it would
take only a few minutes. It was too bad
about the headache; he should have taken his
coffee at breakfast. And Milly drove off, a
vision of gentle serenity, and left him gasping
in the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro went back with her in time for dinner.
Milly had passed the pale stage and was in
unwonted and most becoming excitement.
Caro, of course, was enraptured with the whole
situation. She is the only soul alive who ever
held Cousin Jason in check; and now she infuriated
him with her innocent remarks, and
made him laugh the next moment in spite of
himself, which made him more furious still.
After dinner they retired to Milly’s room and
discussed Bobolink’s perfections—and David’s,
I wonder?—until the latest of late bedtimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At breakfast Cousin Jason was more than
crabbed; but he drank the last of his coffee,
and made quite a hearty meal before pronouncing
the very excellent waffles unfit for
human consumption and slamming the dining-room
door after him as he went out. Caro
had then seen Milly off to the city, where she
was to do a little shopping and “take a bobolink
lunch,” and would go back to spend the
night with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro will stay there all the time Grace is
away. She is in the highest of spirits over
the prospect, not only because a battle with
Cousin Jason has been one of her life-long
desires; but because she is more than weary
of Cousin Jane, and her blunderbuss manner
of forcing conversation anent Bob White.
Caro won’t say much about it—for fear, I
devoutly hope, that I may draw inferences
in David’s favor; but she is unconcealably
bored with Bob, and his money, and his pedigree
and connections, clear back to Noah. I
doubt if the boy ever had a chance with her;
but if he had—or would have had without
Cousin Jane’s disastrous approval of him—it
is only a might-have-been henceforth. I
feel a little sorry for him, but not much. He
was crazy about Olive Wilson last year, and
will be crazy about somebody else before long.
He’s one of those fellows who find a pretty
girl a necessary adjunct to life, and if one can’t
be had, he will cheerfully and whole-heartedly
look for another. When he gets her, he
will settle down with her contentedly, and make
a devoted and exemplary spouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course I keep David posted. And of
course he wants me to. But he never alludes
to Caro in his letters, which are long and interesting,
and determinedly cheerful. The
little sinner asks for them unblushingly every
time she comes over, and is delighted that
“dear David” is enjoying himself so, and is
so in love with the West. She is ostentatiously
fond of him, in a lofty, elder-sisterly manner,
and makes frequent inquiries about his health,
which appears to be unromantically robust.
I cannot see the slightest change in her, except
for a wistfulness in her pretty eyes, when she
has to say good-bye and go away; and sometimes
a fleeting quiver in her smile when she
finds me back in bed, as she has done so often
of late. I am glad we are to leave together
soon, for I can scarcely bear this continual
sending her away. I don’t think she can mind
going, busy and active as she is, as I mind
having her go. I really am a very old lady
to be so upset with youthful love affairs: I’m
positively decrepit. But if one will have the
fun of having children, I suppose one must
pay the piper sometimes.</p>

<hr class='tbk144'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>June 6th.</span> I think I am learning the art
of living; and isn’t that worth a bit of pain?
It is to discover the best in the present moment,
though it be no larger than a needle in a
haystack, and getting the good of it while one
has it. One can relax one’s mind by force
of will, and hold it open to small pleasures
and tiny interests; and such little things may
become one’s salvation in desperate straits!
I think that is one of life’s greatest needs,
especially as one grows older, or if one is
ill—that one should guard and cherish the
capacity for enjoyment of trifles. It is to
the soul what elasticity of the arteries is to
the body; for through it the currents of our
thoughts and feelings run in swift and wholesome
tides, to the upbuilding of the inner life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there’s always something. Though the
children have run away, I have the birds.</p>

<hr class='tbk145'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>June 7th.</span> Milly has crossed her Rubicon,
sure enough. I was propped up in bed yesterday
evening, with my tray before me, and
the Peon was eating his dinner from a flower-garnished
table beside me, when there came a
sudden gust of laughter in the hall, and a
moment later she and Caro came in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mammy Lil, won’t you please give
us something to eat?” Caro besought. “Just
a bite of your fried chicken, Daddy Jack, for
two beautiful damsels in distress; and a pinch
of oats or something for a poor little pin-feathered
bird we’ve got in the hall that’s most mad
enough to chew nails—or would be if he were
not a saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Lincoln is in the parlor, Cousin
John,” said Milly. “We don’t want any
dinner, of course—he’s going back to town
in a few minutes; he just drove us over from
home. We want to stay all night—Caro and
I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Peon was already in the hall. Milly
looked wonderfully pretty, with that light in
her eyes, and a soft color in her cheeks, like
fire behind a pearl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed we do want dinner!” exclaimed
Caro. “Come along and help me forage.
There’s no use in Bobolink’s going back. He
can stay at the hotel in Chatterton tonight,
and get back in plenty of time for his business
in the morning.—Poor Mammy Lil! We’re
not telling you a thing; but I’ll come back in
a minute with the whole tale, as soon as I get
dinner started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped a kiss on the end of my nose—her
favorite spot for such attentions—and
went out, drawing Milly after her. I heard
them in the dining-room with the servants,
and then Caro’s gay voice in the parlor a
moment; and then she came back to me. She
picked a drumstick from the Peon’s dish, and
sat on my bed gnawing it, joyfully reminiscent
of her recent adventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mammy Lil,” she began impressively,
“jay-baiting is the grandest sport ever invented.
Milly doesn’t appreciate the fun of
it as much as she might, but she’s dead game;
and I’ve been having the time of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too bad that Mr. Lincoln couldn’t
have been kept free from it, dear. How did
that happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that wasn’t our fault at all. He
often comes out in the afternoon and takes
Milly out in his car. Then he goes to the hotel
in Chatterton for supper, and comes back
for the evening. He hardly ever sees Cousin
Jay, and when he does, there’s never been any
trouble since that time Milly told you about;
she’s made him leave at half-past nine ever
since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They came back early from their drive because
I was to be there, and he stopped for a
little visit before dinner. He doesn’t stop
usually—they stay out till the last minute;
and Cousin Jay just jumped to the conclusion
Milly had asked him to dinner. We
have been teaching Cousin Jay to eat all the
breakfast he wants before he leaves the table,
and one or two other things, too. If he’s too
horrid at dinner we go to our room afterward,
and leave him all the evening with nobody to
quarrel at. And I suppose he just meant to
get even. He came out and told Milly and
me to go in the house and get ready for dinner,
for he was tired of waiting for us. And
then he turned around to Mr. Lincoln—he
hadn’t spoken to him at all—and said, ‘It’s
time for you to be going, young man, and you
needn’t come back after supper. I’m tired of
your hanging around here.’ And then he turned
on his heel and walked to the house. Oh,
I was so mad I could hear my hair crackle!
Just feel how crisped-up and woolly it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent forward on the bed and pushed
her soft curls under my hand, burrowing her
nose in the covers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did Mr. Lincoln do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just behaved like an angel. He didn’t
have a thought but for Milly. He forgot all
about me, and spoke to her as if they were
alone. Mammy Lil, that man’s sweet. He’ll
do for Milly, and I told him so afterwards.
But Milly was a perfect joy. She gave Bobolink
one adoring look. It went to my very
toes, so I don’t know what it did to him; and
then she said, in the quietest way:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you stay here for a few minutes
and wait for me? I’m coming back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he said he’d wait till doomsday, of
course! and she took my hand without a word,
and into the house we went. It wasn’t nearly
dinner time. We went by the back way, and
she stopped in the kitchen long enough to tell
Jule she wouldn’t be home for several days,
and what to do for Cousin Jason. Then we
went upstairs and packed a couple of suitcases,
and I called Joe to take them down
stairs. We all went down the front way, and
there he was in the hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What the deuce are you doing?’ he snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m going out of this house,’ said Milly,
as quietly as if she’d said she were going out
on the porch; ‘and I’m not coming back till
you learn your place in it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I reckon you’ll learn some sense when
your mother comes home,’ he sneered. ‘Go
play the fool if you want to.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milly didn’t seem to hear him; and somehow
that still, deep anger of hers made me
ashamed to sputter, so I never said a word.
He slammed the door behind us, and we all
got in Bobolink’s car and came over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milly told him what she had said to Cousin
Jay, and they fixed everything in two minutes.
Milly won’t write a word to Cousin
Grace, because she’s just obliged to stay with
old Mrs. Wood till her daughter gets back,
and there’s no use in worrying her. I know
you’ll let Milly stay here; and when Cousin
Grace comes back, if she’ll make Cousin Jay
behave, or go away, Milly will go home and
wait to be married till her mother wishes. But
if Cousin Grace won’t stop him, Milly’s going
to marry Bobolink right off, in church,
with just the clothes she has. And I think
she’s exactly right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s right to come here and wait for
Grace to settle it,” I said; “and Grace will
settle it right, I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I was half afraid, even as I said it.
Cousin Jason has bent Grace like a reed from
her babyhood, and almost—perhaps not quite—broken
her. Could she stand against him,
even if she would?</p>

<hr class='tbk146'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>June 9th.</span> Could she indeed? As if love
couldn’t set the gentlest face like a flint!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were all in here this morning, Milly
and Caro both busy with a lace-y frock for
the bride-to-be—“just in case she has to be
a bride next week”—when I saw Grace driving
up. I did not tell them she was coming,
and her arms were around Milly before the
child knew she was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You darling!” said Grace; “you’ll have
to forgive me dear, as Robert has done. He’s
coming out this afternoon to take dinner and
spend the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Milly gave a little gasp, and then dropped
her head on her mother’s shoulder and began
to cry. Caro snatched up the filmy stuff they
were working on, threw it over Milly like a
bridal veil, and pirouetted around the two,
crooning the dolefulest tune imaginable, her
eyes dancing with fun. Grace looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t stop petting Milly a minute,” Caro
exhorted; “she’s a perfect heroine, and Bobolink’s
a dear. I’m just singing a requiem for
my jay-bird kin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Mother,” asked Milly, sitting up,
“how ever did you hear about it? And how
did you happen to come home so soon? And
when did you see—Robert?” She blushed
beautifully as she called his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your uncle telephoned me night before
last. I knew he had everything wrong, of
course; but I was sure that enough was the
matter for me to come home and see about it.
It was all right to leave Mother, for Annie
promised to stay, and Mary is coming the last
of the week. So I telephoned Robert to meet
me in town yesterday at twelve o’clock. I
stayed there last night because there were several
things to do in taking business affairs into
my own hands again; and before I saw Brother
Jason I had to think out clearly what I wished
to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I went there first this morning.” She
hesitated, a troubled look in her eyes. Milly
drew her closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor mother!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is your uncle who needs sympathy, dear,
though he will not have it. And I know it is
partly my fault, and partly the whole family’s,
as well as his. We have all given up to him all
our lives, under color of being kind and patient
and magnanimous, and all that, when at the
bottom we were just afraid to oppose him; and
he—suffers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Mother, I’m sorry!” cried Milly. “I’ll
give up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Cousin Grace, I call that a shame,”
broke in Caro. “No matter what you and Milly
do, you make a fault and a penance out of
it to shield him and hurt yourselves. It isn’t
fair. He knows he’s outrageous, and he doesn’t
care; and I just think he ought to be hurt, to
find out what he’s been doing to other people.
If he’s gone, do let Milly enjoy herself, for
once. But is he gone, really?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s going,” said Grace. “I wanted him
to stay, as my guest, and not as the master of
the house. But he—he was very angry. He is
to leave this morning, while I am here. He’s
going back to his own house and live there all
alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a mighty good thing for him,” declared
Caro. “When I used to indulge in
tantrums like his, Mammy Lil always made me
go stay by myself till I was what she called
a social creature. I think I’ll go over and see
Cousin Jason and tell him about it. I could
always come back the second I was willing to
be polite, and so can he. Think of Cousin Jason’s
emerging a social creature! Butterflies
and caterpillars won’t be in it. But if Milly
isn’t to be married next week, when do we begin
on the trousseau?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talk passed into a discussion of clothes,
and drifted about that interesting topic till
time for them to go home. They found their
house empty, except for the servants. Cousin
Jason had gone, as he said, without eating
again beneath his sister’s roof.</p>

<hr class='tbk147'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>June 16th.</span> I suppose the excitement of
Cousin Jason’s deposition was a little too much
for me: I’ve been curled up dead-’possum-fashion
for a week. Now I’m uncurling again,
and showing that, like the ’possum, I’m not so
dead as I look. Caro came back, whether or no,
and took charge of me. It is a great comfort
to have her.</p>

<hr class='tbk148'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>June 19th.</span> A slow pull and a hard one. But
I make it, inch by inch.</p>

<hr class='tbk149'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>June 21st.</span> Courage, patience and laughter—life
would be impossible without them. Yet
the first necessity, and the last, is love. If
one only loves enough, one can fight anything,
and fight always, while breath and consciousness
last.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>July 7th.</span> I have seen the woods in summer
time again! It was winter when I left home for
those three years, and winter when I went back;
and, though one does not think of the country
passed in a winter journey as dead—for the
winter’s story of life reserved is as vivid as the
summer one of life out-poured—yet one longs
to see, far out-spread in breeze and sunshine,
the close-shut life of the winter buds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the doctor would allow it, the
Peon and Caro brought me here. We came
through the mountains nearly all the way—one
long splendor of rhododendrons, wild phlox,
azaleas, laurel, and briar rose, all in glorious
bloom; and above them the green billows of the
trees, with great masses of chestnut blooms
for foam. And everywhere the mountains
themselves, green and dark near at hand, and
blue and faint in the distance; and between
them the valleys, heaped with beauty and over-flowing
with life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Boss and the Madam met us in Baltimore,
and brought us to this heavenly place.
My room is downstairs, with windows on three
sides, and wide doors opening on a quiet end
of the wide piazza, which nearly encircles the
house. I can be wheeled there, straight from
the bed, to a couch-like hammock, where a
cranky back may be as comfortable as its own
bad temper will allow; and my bed is under a
long row of windows, just as it is at home. I
can look out across the small plateau, occupied
by the cottage grounds, to mountains, near
and far, and to the glory of the sunset skies.
And again, from the porch, on mountains, and
slopes where the summer cottagers have set
their beautiful homes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was ashamed to come here in this battered
condition; when the Madam wrote for us I expected
to be walking all about by the time I
came. But they would have me, and the Peon
and Caro were of the same mind. For myself,
I can scarcely imagine a lovelier place to get
well in; the loving-kindness indoors is as fine
a tonic as the mountain air outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have not seen any of the Peon’s family in
all these years of my invalidism, but I find
them in spirit just where I left them—and in
body, too, for that matter; for health and love
and happiness are a combination to defy time,
and the heads of the household are still a bridal
pair. Their youthful names for one another,
long since adopted by the rest of us, suit their
sunny middle-age as well as ever; so the “Boss”
and the “Madam” they remain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the daughters is married, and will
make but a brief visit this summer. The other,
known as Hazel-eyes, is the light of the big
house; a quiet little body, wonderfully pretty,
her mother’s shadow and her father’s adorer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Peon stayed only a couple of days, and
went back to our empty nest. He is to go
West before long, and will come here on his
return to tell me all about David.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro is restless and unusually silent, not
doing herself justice among strangers. The
child has been severely taxed in the last few
weeks, and shows it plainly. The roses are all
gone, and her eyes are tired and sad. She
seems like a new Caro whom I must learn to
know. I know I was ill for awhile, though not
as ill as they thought; and she never saw me
suffer that way before. But it isn’t that which
clouds her bright eyes—it can’t be, no matter
what she says, now that I am past the worst of
it. I wonder will she ever open her heart to
me about David. She used to tell me everything.
I always said the test of my success in
mothering her would come with her falling in
love; if she came to me with that, I would know
I had done my work aright. And now I see
that I have failed. If I had been her real mother
I would have known better how to reach her.
It is a real motherhood to me, of course, but not
to Caro—and perhaps not even to David. So
I must lie here and wait, like any other outsider,
till everybody knows how it turns out.</p>

<hr class='tbk151'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>July 9th.</span> Yesterday Caro wheeled me out
to the line of locusts, which cuts this plateau in
half and divides the Boss’s grounds from his
neighbor’s. A song sparrow came to call at
once, a dear little fellow, all streaks and music.
They sing here all day long—they and
the winter wrens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flicker has a clamorous brood in the tallest
locust; they cry every moment, except when
their wail is gagged by a worm. Their parents
toil incessantly, but I should think their
nerves would be on edge. The bluebird mothers,
too, are hard at work, for there are dozens
of bluebird babies to feed, and bluebird fathers
never turn a wing or lend a bill to their upbringing.
The babies are cunning, speckled
things, their big round eyes ringed with white,
giving them an expression of child-like wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This afternoon I am out on my end of the
porch, in the hammock. Caro has gone with
Hazel-eyes and a party of young folks on an
expedition to Bare Rock—a great shelf of
granite which juts out near the top of the
mountain to the north of us, and from which
there is a wonderful view. The Madam is
entertaining visitors on the other side of the
porch, and I am finding the solitude I need a
constant temptation to Grumpyish thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When one wants to bog down, there are always
such unassailable reasons for doing it!
I have faced Grumpy down and out about the
pain. And I’ve done fairly well about the idleness;
that isn’t a losing fight, at least. But I’m
just bowled over about the children. And it
isn’t altogether that they’re suffering, though
that hurts. It’s because they’re suffering away
from me, and I can’t do anything until they
choose to take me into their confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’ve been lying here thinking how Grumpy
must be enjoying my back-sliding till I’ve
made up my mind to fight him to a finish on this
also. They have a right to their secrets and to
their own lives; it’s the right and natural way.
I never repaid Great-aunt Letitia’s love to her,
any more than she repaid her mother’s. You
don’t pay love back; you pay it forward. The
great-aunts paid their love-debt, not to their
mother, but to me; and I’ve paid what I owed
them to David and Caro; and Caro and David
won’t pay to me—they can’t; they’ll pay it to
children yet unborn. Why can’t I accept the
law, and be glad? It’s trying to grab what
isn’t one’s share that makes all the trouble in
life, anyway. I’ve always said the most secure
possession was the one carried in an open handle
and free to fly at a breath: I’ll carry the children
that way now. And for amusement, there
are still the birds.</p>

<hr class='tbk152'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>July 10th.</span> As I lay on the porch this afternoon,
facing the great mountain to the north,
the long fingers of the westering light touched
the foamy white tops of the chestnut trees,
still crowned with their mist of bloom. The
light slid across the hollows of the mountain-side,
filling the long curves with dark green
shadows, a soft, deep background for the maples
of the nearer lawns, all golden green in
the full sunlight, and for the silver of the wind-ruffled
poplars. Locust trees are on every
side, a survival of the native forests. Where
the light is reflected from their leaves, they are
a dark bluish green; but where the sun strikes
through them, each leaflet is shining gold, and
the long leaves sway at the end of every branch
like giant fronds gleaming under some Midas
touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even the locusts are far away, across the
many-acred lawn. The trees near the house
are too young and small to shelter birds; and
if I go out to the locusts their foliage is too
light and too high to shade my eyes from the
glare: so I have been missing the birds. If I
could stay with the others it wouldn’t matter;
but I must lie alone, and in silence, resting between
lines when I write; and Grumpy is boring
company. So I’ve been casting envious
looks at a place across the road. A long hedge
of blossoming privet hides everything but the
tree-tops, but there are dozens of them; and
wings flash in and out. It is a large place,
larger than this; I know there’s a corner in it
there I wouldn’t be in the way. The sense of
something near and unknown, yet knowable,
draws me daily. The Garden of Delight I call
it, and listen for the songs which float from it,
and long for its shade and sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Madam came to sit with me I
confessed my daft condition to her, and she
went across the road to the Garden’s owners—two
ladies who are friends of hers—and returned
presently with the freedom of the Garden
for me and my chair. I am to go tomorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wonder sometimes if people dream of the
pleasure they can give through little things.
To these ladies I suppose their bit of hospitality
is a trifle soon forgotten; but to me it is pure
delight. It will hearten me for my fight a
thousand times, and lift me clear above the
pain a thousand more. It is hard to keep
steady when one is so happy. The long, filmy
curves of wind-swept silver in the evening sky
grow suddenly dim; and when they wheel me
back to bed I am “fair lifted,” as the Scotch
say, and wait joyfully in the darkness for such
sleep as night may bring.</p>

<hr class='tbk153'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>July 11th.</span> The Garden of Delight! A
close-shaven sward from which the tiniest bird
stands up distinctly; and trees, and trees, and
trees! Shrubs and vines, rose-beds, azaleas,
tall altheas, clumps of iris, masses of old-fashioned
lilies, tangles of honeysuckles on the
fences, beds of early phlox, ragged robins,
larkspur, and ferns—all things cool and quiet
and sweet. In the dense shade of tall shrubs
they have left me, the feathery locusts waving
overhead, and before me a hitherto unsuspected
vista of beauty—the long, long valley which
leads to Gettysburg, with the mountains
guarding it on either side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the greensward lies a beautiful bit
of wilderness—ferns and wild flowers under
thick-set trees; beyond that, close-shaven grass
again, then a bit of clover, and a tangle out of
the very heart of the woods. And everywhere
are birds. And I, who have longed for the
woods for years, and who have never dreamed
of finding them outside of the land of Make-Believe,
I am here, far off, a thousand miles
from everywhere, alone with the sky and the
winds and the wild mountains, in a silence of
upper air! One can bear one’s body in a place
like this: it doesn’t matter that it cannot run,
nor walk. One’s mind can run, and fly, and
rise so high that the pain lies far below, lost,
vanished, like a pebble in the valley when one
looks from a free mountain peak against the
sky. For one glorious hour I have run away
from it—this pain that wrenches and grips;
I have been free, free! And so my hope
grows bold, and I reach out to touch that
happy future when I shall be free in body as
well as in mind: it will come—some day!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And oh, foolish one, remember, and learn!
For the Garden of Delight was close at hand
all the time, only I hadn’t the wit to reach it
till my body was carried thither. But there
is always a Garden, if one can find it—a
Garden of Delight, hidden behind the hedge!</p>

<hr class='tbk154'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>July 15th.</span> The birds are not kind today,
even here in the Garden. It is a grey evening,
for one thing, and the light is bad for spying
out secrets among the leaves. The weather
is misty and damp, promising the rain we
need; but everything is dry from recent heat,
and the insects may be less juicy than usual,
and not very tempting eating. Anyway, the
birds are not here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mist, with the dim light of the evening
sun upon it, spreads a film of silver over the
blues and greens of the mountains. Down
in the valley it deepens till all the colors are
faint and soft, from the pale stubble of the
nearer wheatfields all up the long valley between
the mountains, to where the dim blue
of the great battlefield melts into the dim
blue of the sky above it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was down this Valley, over the road at
my feet, that the men of the Southern army
tramped after the battle was lost. My own
kinsmen were there, following their great
leader with the rest, as he passed through the
Valley of Defeat. How much seemed lost to
them, who can say? But to us of a later
generation how plain it is that nothing was
lost at Gettysburg which it were well to keep.
The really priceless thing they brought away
unharmed—the courage which could accept
defeat, and turn, without a murmur, in the
wreck of the old order, to the upbuilding of
a new world. That was a struggle which the
world even now knows little of, though it was
as wide as the South and as long as a generation’s
life-time. It was fought singly, and
in silence, in each individual life. Each soul
bled inwardly, and only God saw the wounds.
But I have sprung from men who fought
that fight. Let me look at the Valley, and
learn.</p>

<hr class='tbk155'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>July 18th.</span> The wind is at play in the
mountains today, and sweeps up the Valley
with a sound as of rushing waters, bending
the trees before it. The long shadows
under the swaying branches know not a
moment’s rest; and the racing clouds shift
the shafts of sunlight so rapidly from place
to place that the very earth seems moving,
like the lightest leaf. Few birds are abroad,
save the robins, which battle against the unseen
powers of the air, only to be blown like
autumn leaves. A thrasher, dashed suddenly
in front of me, began at once a philosophic
hunt for worms—one place was as good as
another, no doubt; but a young robin, the black
of his crown still separated from the dark
ear-coverts by bands of gray, crouches frightened
where he falls. His half-drooped wings
show a power which explains his venturing
abroad; he is full grown, though not yet in
full robin dress. He is learning the old lesson
of the young: that there are things in life which
not even grown-ups can do; and that his liberty
is merely a liberty to adjust himself to
forces which he cannot hope to control. No
wonder he looks a bit dazed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mistress of the Garden comes out presently
to look after her flowers. Her face is
good to see, and her voice to listen to. Her
eyes have the look of one who dwells in that
place of peace where happiness and sorrow
are fused into one, and are known as equal
essentials of the highest joy. She is a lover
of Nature, too. One inevitably comes to be,
I think, as one travels the long road to serenity
of soul. One may observe Nature in
youth, no doubt, and love it, too, somewhat;
but the real sense of kinship with it is a matter
of living, and of growth.</p>

<hr class='tbk156'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>July 25th.</span> Blessed be trees and sunshine,
the open sky, and the free winds which fill
it! And blessed be the freshness and promise
of the new day, coming alike to the light-hearted
and to those pain-weary and discouraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the promise never fails. For, whether
the new day brings escape or courage, relief
or a growing power of patience, whether it
means joy or peace, it brings good, and only
good; and so through all the soul its <span class='it'>sursum
corda</span> rings with sweetness and command.</p>

<hr class='tbk157'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>July 28th.</span> After wheeling me over to the
Garden yesterday afternoon, Caro left me, to
join in an expedition to Bare Rock. When
she had gone, I discovered to my horror that
I had been deposited beneath the branch of
a poplar tree on which some hundreds of
caterpillars had just been hatched out. They
were so thick that heads, tails and sides touched
everywhere, as they lay on leaves and stems;
not one could move a hair’s breadth without
knocking off the others or climbing over them.
What they thought of my proximity I had no
means of finding out; but for me it was not
a joyful occasion. I could move neither my
chair nor myself; so I lay there, gazing up at
the wretched things till I began turning into
a caterpillar myself, and felt fuzz and wriggles
sprouting all over me. But before the
transformation was too far advanced to be
checked, I heard Caro’s voice behind me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mammy Lil, I don’t want to go walking.
May I stay and talk to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been feeling specially lonesome of
late. I kept telling myself I was getting morbid
from long illness and solitude; but it
seemed to me that Caro almost avoided me.
She waited on me most thoughtfully; but her
errands done, she disappeared. There was
no more of that dear companionship, when she
used to sit near me, reading, or embroidering,
while she sang dreamily to herself, or cuddled
her head against mine on the pillows in a fellowship
which needed no words. Children can’t
possibly understand how bereft one feels, shut
out. I knew she loved me too well to hurt
me; yet I had missed her, under the same
roof with her, more than I had missed David
far away: the boy had never shut me out like
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her voice was different as she asked
her question now. I remembered how, years
ago, she used to come out of her periods of
seclusion in the parlor “nice and social,” as
she would sweetly announce, and confess her
little soul inside out, clear to her very toes.
Before I saw her face I knew the barrier was
gone, and I was to have her confidence at
last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, first of all, I craved deliverance from
the caterpillars. Some of them had hunched
themselves up ominously, as if they were about
to jump down and float across my nose on
silken threads. I was very unhappy indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro squealed in horror when she saw my
plight, and snatched me back from my impending
doom. She wheeled me across the
shaven grass to the edge of the wood-tangle,
and sat on a rock beside me, facing the long
Valley once filled with marching men—men
who marched from the disaster of outward
defeat to the victory of inner conquest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mammy Lil,” she inquired presently, “do
you love me any more at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned my face to her without speaking.
Her eyes filled with sudden tears, and she
laid her cheek against my hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the darlingest mother! If you
weren’t, I’d be ashamed to tell you. Mammy
Lil, I’ve wished sometimes I could murder
myself, this last year; I’ve been so cross. It
began last summer while I was home on vacation.
Everybody in Chatterton made love
to Milly or me last summer, except David. He
was just as he always was—sweet to both of
us, but specially careful of me because he was
my brother. And I didn’t feel the same to him
at all. I—Mammy Lil, I was as foolish about
David as those boys were about us two girls:
I was in love with him, over head and ears.”
She paused while I stroked her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t think how ashamed I was. And
of course I treated him like a yellow dog.
And he behaved <span class='it'>perfectly</span>. I was sure, though,
that he didn’t suspect—he, nor any one else.
And then, at the end of the summer, Cousin
Jane told me that David and I were to marry.
I didn’t believe you’d ever talked to her about
it, of course; but I saw in a flash what it
would mean to you—and that David might
do it to please you. And I was afraid Cousin
Jane suspected what a fool I was. And she
went to David, too, and told me that, and
told him she’d told me. I did want to wring
Cousin Jane’s neck; and I think yet she deserved
it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“David and I had a talk. She just butted
our heads together till we had to. He said
he’d always cared; but he had made up his
mind to wait till I was through school and you
were at home again: it wasn’t fair not to.
He was lovely. But he was so quiet—and so
confident, it seemed to me. I tried to lay him
out; I was mad. And he wouldn’t blame me
a bit for being mad; but he said he hadn’t
asked for any answer yet, and wouldn’t take
one till he did ask for it; and that we mustn’t
worry you with Cousin Jane’s nonsense, and
all that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things rocked along at Christmas, except
that I cared more than ever. But when I
came back last spring to stay, as soon as you
were really better, David began to show me
that he—you know, Mammy Lil, how much
little things can be made to mean. And I
began to see he did care just as I did. We
were so happy in April! Only, I kept staving
the end of it off. I didn’t want to be pinned
down too soon. But David—he understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Cousin Jane had to take a hand
again. She’d found out Bob White wanted
to marry me—or thought he did; and Bob is
what she calls a ‘catch.’ She nabbed me that
day, as I was coming home from Milly’s, and
said the hatefullest things you ever heard in
your life—that everybody said I was ‘setting
my cap’ for David and pretending to be taking
care of you when I was just running after
him; and that David had given her to understand
he felt very badly about it, because he
knew you and I wanted it so much!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew as well as I knew my name that
was a lie out of whole cloth; but I was just
as angry as if it were true. I never had been
reconciled to caring about him before he spoke,
anyway. So I went to Cousin Jane’s, as she
told me to, and listened to Bob White’s praises
till I was sick of everything under the sun.
And when David and I went out that afternoon—Mammy
Lil, can’t you understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear, I did it myself, once; I ought to
understand. But I paid for it afterwards, as
you have done. When you’re an old lady
like me you’ll know better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know better now,” she said, with a sudden
quiver in her voice. “I—I killed David’s
respect for me that afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, child,” I exclaimed, “he knows
you—and loves you—too well for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t love me at all; he can’t. I
let him think—I pretended—I’d just been flirting
with him; to lead Bob on.” Her voice
died in a shamed silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was serious news, considering David’s
nature. If he believed she really cared for
some one else, I knew it would take a long time
for the notion to work out of his head; and
while it was in there he wouldn’t stir. And
I had promised not to interfere. I stroked
her soft hair in silence for a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“David will never change in his love for
you, dear,” I said; “it’s too truly a part of
him for that. And when people really love
one another, they come together, somehow,
soon or late; your Daddy Jack and I were
hopelessly separated for weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been separated nearly three
months,” said Caro, dolefully; “eleven weeks
and four days today. But I’m not going to
talk about David any more. What hurts me
most of all is the way I’ve treated you. You
ought to hate me if you don’t. I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I laid my hand over her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use of being older than you
if I can’t understand, child? And I’ve travelled
every step of the way before. Everything
that isn’t right will come right between
you and David; but with you and me everything
is right already. Just drop your troubles
under the trees, dearie, as I do, and open
your heart to the hills and the sky. Isn’t
today worth yesterday’s storm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat up and looked across the Valley.
The mountains stood out in the afternoon sunlight
all the clearer for the long shadows already
gathering in the hollows; each leaf and
grass blade was shining fresh after the rain,
and everywhere was a flutter and stir of wings.
A nuthatch crept down a locust trunk before
us, a yellow-billed cuckoo slipped by overhead;
and all down the hillside the swallows
swept in long, beautiful curves, their bright
breasts shining against the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear,” I said presently, “don’t you see,
out of doors here, how wise it is to take the
long look at life? The mountains make me
ashamed of my fretting. And life is working
toward this beauty all the time; the winters
in the way don’t matter; they pass. And yet
before they pass they teach us to love life
better when it re-appears. When your happiness
is safe in your hands once more, you
won’t hurt it again for a child’s anger or a
fool’s speech. I know; for I learned it, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid her cheek against my hand in
silence, and we watched together while the
sun went down. The blue shadows overflowed
the hollows of the mountains and met across
the green ridges on their sides. Against that
shadowed background the poplars of the Garden,
smitten by the last rays of sunlight, shone
like silver, and the locusts like fronds of gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far below, in the Valley, lay the peace of
the coming twilight, and all about us were
the soft murmuring of birdlings settling down
to rest, and of mothers crooning over them
as they slept. And at last the gardener came
over from the Madam’s, and wheeled me back,
with Caro by my side.</p>

<hr class='tbk158'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>August 2nd.</span> The Peon is with David now,
and I shall soon be having news. He did not
start as early as he hoped, and was detained
on the way; but being there at last, he will
soon be able to tell me something definite
about David’s coming home. I haven’t meddled
a meddle: not that I’ve earned any frill
to my halo thereby; it’s just that I know by
my own past Caro would catch up with me
if I tried it, even if I hadn’t promised David.
So I’m pinning my hopes to the Peon: he
has been so very non-committal that he must
have something on his mind. But I can’t
share these hopes with Caro, and they wouldn’t
help her if I could: she is in that stage of
penitence where it is against her principles for
her to accept consolation, so far as David is
concerned. Her misery, poor little soul, is the
only comfort she can allow herself; and if her
happiness is to have a thorough recovery, the
process cannot be hurried.</p>

<hr class='tbk159'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>August 5th.</span> I woke at half-past four this
morning to find a fat white cloud sitting on
the lawn outside, as if he owned the premises.
Not a mountain visible; and beneath the locusts’
misty arches the trees on the neighboring
lawn gleam pale and uncertain, mere grey-green
ghosts of living things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cloud isn’t altogether outside. My
books on the stand beside me are arching their
covers with the dampness, and my field-glasses
are moist to the touch; the room feels dank
and uncanny, and the heavy air is hard to
breathe. One needs a mental rain-coat on a
day like this—especially when no letters come
from a sky-larking Peon!</p>

<hr class='tbk160'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>August 8th.</span> Days of rain on the parched
earth. Gray days, with soft mists heaped
against the mountains, blending earth and sky
in one. Days when one’s horizon is lost—not
gone, but withdrawn from sight; days when
the mountains have vanished and the valleys
melted away, and nothing is very clear to consciousness
but this small bed and the pain which
lies upon it. If mists crept as close about one’s
inner vision, doubt would seem normal on days
like this, and despair the quintessence of common
sense. Yet under the veiling vapors the
brown grass is growing green again, the hard
earth soft, instinct with power, and prodigal
of gifts once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now comes a distant roll of thunder, a wind
that sweeps the vapors from the grass as tears
are wiped from sodden eyes, a flash of blinding
light, a bending and tossing of leaf-laden
boughs; and over the mountain the storm-cloud
rises, black against the pale gray of the sky.
Then up the valley comes the wall of water;
and behind it the world is new.</p>

<hr class='tbk161'/>

<p class='pindent'>A special delivery letter from the Peon!
Caro stood by while I opened it, asking nothing,
but her color coming and going. It was
only a few lines; but it said he would be here
on the tenth. He has written not a word since
he has been out there about the things nearest
to all our hearts; but at least we shall know
something in two days more.</p>

<div><h1><a id='gard'></a>XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='sc'>In the Garden of Delight</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>August 10th.</span> They are having a picnic
supper on Bare Rock this evening, from which
nobody in the house is excused but myself.
I am glad they are all gone, for I need a
little solitude, in this sudden whirlwind of happiness,
to catch my breath and take a twist
on my emotions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the Peon, who is so literally truthful
that nobody dares to suspect him of juggling
with words, deliberately stole a march on us
and walked in twenty-four hours ahead of
time—with David! Caro and I were over in
the Garden. I was just where I am now,
between the altheas and the locusts; but Caro,
who had been wandering restlessly about, had
gone down the hillside, out of sight, following
an unknown bird-note. I was looking at the
poplar branch where the caterpillars had clustered.
They had left it stripped of everything
but the leaf-stalks, which stood out now
from the bare twigs at every angle, like drunken
pins in a cushion. But the birds had days
ago avenged both the branch and me, for not
a crawler was visible on the tree. I was looking
at it idly when the Peon and David suddenly
stood under it, coming round the big
bed of hydrangeas between it and the gate!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I scarcely saw the Peon for looking at
David; but David was looking for somebody
else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Caro?” he demanded, as he kissed
me. “They said at the house she was
over here with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s beyond that little corner of woods,”
I said; “go around there and you’ll see her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he went I fell upon the Peon, and extracted
the hitherto suppressed information
that Bob White’s engagement to some visitor
from Kentucky had been announced last
month. The Peon had forgotten her name;
but he carried the news to David, who decided
it was time for him to see Caro at once. And
the mischief of a time he was taking about
it, too, the Peon observed impatiently; didn’t
they intend to take us into the secret before
midnight?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it was still half an hour to sunset, I
reproved him properly; but I was myself beginning
to fear something had gone wrong
when they appeared at last. The dusk had
fallen, and I could not see their faces clearly;
but I heard a soft, happy laugh from Caro
before they came around the corner of the
woods, and I knew everything was all
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David had certainly not wasted his time.
They were already considering the house that
must be built on the knoll the Peon and I
had selected years ago. It seems he had picked
it out himself, and Caro had agreed to it, in
her mud-pie days. Now, having waited so
long, and finding Caro in a mood of undreamed-of
submissiveness, he had taken matters
into his own hands, and decided that he
would go home as soon as they could settle
on the plans, and begin the house at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll need it, even so, before we can possibly
get into it,” he observed to me. “Do
you remember what you said to me that night
about our wedding? I told Caro about it
this afternoon, and she couldn’t deny that we
ought not to start out in life by disgracing
you as a prophet. So it’s to be before Christmas—in
September, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’ve lost your wits,” replied
Caro. “It won’t be Christmas if Mammy Lil
isn’t walking about everywhere by Thanksgiving.
She needn’t expect us to live up to
her prophecies if she won’t do it herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I will,” I replied cheerfully; “I feel
it in my bones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s surely time,” said David, turning my
chair to the gate. The Peon and Caro walked
on ahead, and the boy bent down and rubbed
my cheek with his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweet Mammy, I know I’ve been hard
on you these months; but we’ll both make it
up to you now. Forgive us this time, and let
us help to make you well at last.”</p>

<hr class='tbk162'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>August 22nd.</span> What beautiful, happy days
we have had! I showed the Peon all the wonders
of the Garden; and David and Caro
strayed in and out, sometimes with the Madam
and her other guests, and sometimes in that
dual solitude lovers crave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told the Peon about Grumpy one day.
I never had mentioned him before, because
I never had been quite sure, if I did, that it
wouldn’t break the spell I had woven, and
allow him to appear to others as well as to
me. But I’m not afraid of him any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Peon is so satisfactory! He never
thought of laughing at me, but took in the
situation at once. He said the best way to
make sure of getting rid of the wretch was
for him to carry Grumpy away when he went.
He could put him in his suit-case—for Grumpy
really is the tiniest creature imaginable to make
all the trouble he does; and he could throw
him out of the car window as they were crossing
some deep gorge in the mountains where
no human habitation had ever been. A blue
devil can’t possibly live where there are no
people; so there’d be an end of his mischief
forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wasn’t that the cleverest scheme? We
caught him together yesterday afternoon, and
rammed him into the suit-case, good and tight.
And I told the Peon, before he went, that if
he did many more stunts like that, he’d be a
very satisfactory playmate for me when the
children are grown up and in their own house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that is the end of Grumpy.</p>

<hr class='tbk163'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>August 23rd.</span> They have gone back, taking
the plans for the house with them. Caro and
David sketched them together, and he will
have them worked out at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think Caro half envies him the pleasure
of beginning the nest building, and wants to
be there to see; but nobody is willing for me
to go back before the first of October; and
the child has a deal of shopping to do. I
will wait here; and Caro will go to New York
and visit Edith Mason, while she selects her
bridal plumage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I find the birds most joyful company these
days, and am planning to cultivate their acquaintance
in a less formal manner; for I
intend to get out of this chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wheeled-chair is really an exasperating
place to study birds from: I wonder I never
realized it before. This very day the trees
are full of them—new birds, many of them,
gathering for the fall migration. They have
been playing hide-and-seek with me all the
afternoon—a charming game if one can do
one’s own part of it, and go seeking when the
other hides; but if you can’t, it’s not so hilarious.
They poke unknown heads through the
leaves, and survey me coolly. They whisk tails
I can’t even guess at from behind a limb,
and are gone. They sing high overhead, with
only a bit of their under feathers visible, or
flirt a half-seen wing behind an opening in
the leaves. Sorting heads, tails, and middles
is a hopeless job when you haven’t an idea
which belongs to which. If it were only a
Chinese puzzle, you’d know when it was
solved; but a tail with any other head would
look as sweet! I’ve thought all summer that
if a hyper-developed sense of touch can serve
the blind for eyes, surely time and patience
could do the work of feet for me; but I’m
thinking patience may cease to be a virtue
soon!</p>

<hr class='tbk164'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>August 26th.</span> We have had two days of
storm. They mark both a beginning and an
end; for a subtle change has passed over the
mountains and lingers, though wind and rain
be gone. A tinge of brown, merely suspected
before, has deepened and spread until it challenges
and commands the eye. Some of the
nearer trees look seared, and the poplars,
especially, look withered and old. But there
is a beauty of soul deeper than that of the
flesh and of youth: and the depth and power
of Nature’s charm, like the freedom of our
own souls, can be best measured by the number
and splendor of the things which can be laid
aside. All the glamour of the young spring,
the splendid lavishness of summer days, the
riot of color and sunshine—these things, which
yearly draw us with new fascination and delight,
are but the broidered outer curtain of
the temple. They lure us past them, into
the inner court, to a strength which knows no
defeat, to an abundance which can afford to
be stripped; to Law which cannot be thwarted
nor checked; and beyond Law to a Power
which reason can neither explain nor explain
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For myself, I have my message; the hills
have spoken it. And the pain which wrenches
is back where it belongs, in the second place—or
the twentieth. Moreover, it will pass—tomorrow,
or next year, or in a life-time: it
is not of the things which remain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the clouds are breaking for a sunset
glory, and the porch where I lie, and
the lawn beyond it, even the shadowed mountains—all,
all, are flooded with splendid
light.</p>

<hr class='tbk165'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>August 29th.</span> A letter from Cousin Jane
at last! Caro and I both wrote to her while
David was here, but she had not vouchsafed
a reply. David had a satisfactory interview
with Cousin Chad, after his return, but reported
Cousin Jane’s reception of him as one
befitting an unrepentant prodigal who had
brought his swine home with him. So we
have been looking forward to the reception
of a letter from her as a very solemn occasion
indeed. She seems inclined, however, to temper
her disapproval to Caro. She doesn’t expect
her to be happy long, she says; and she handsomely
offers not to disturb her present dreams,
but to wait until Caro is disillusioned, when
she hopes her “I told you so” will do some
good. She does not intend, however, to cause
any breach in the family, her principles forbidding
her to quarrel even with me; and she
is perfectly willing to continue her efforts to
set me a proper example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I suppose, on the whole, that’s doing pretty
well for Cousin Jane. I don’t intend to have
any breach in the family, myself, especially
over the children’s wedding; and Caro and I
will find some way to appease her when we go
home.</p>

<hr class='tbk166'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>August 30th.</span> What bird is that? He is
in the locust yonder, only his breast visible.
It is a vivid yellow, with four irregular scarlet
spots—three on one side and one on the other—and
across his breast a long zig-zag line
of scarlet like a jagged wound. There isn’t
any bird like that: I know it; and if he doesn’t,
he ought to. Yet there he sits, as calm as
if he were in all the books and had as much
right in the Garden as I. I have watched him,
and recorded him, yet he doesn’t move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, I’ll just make him: I’m not tied to
this chair!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A scarlet tanager, moulting! No wonder
I never saw that before. He is always scarlet-and-black
when he goes through Tennessee in
the spring, and yellow and olive when he goes
back in the fall. He looks like the clown in
a circus now, and I don’t wonder that he seeks
the seclusion of the mountains to change his
clothes. He is gone, of course, before I can
apologize for my intrusion; and I suppose his
opinion of me is scarcely fit to print.</p>

<hr class='tbk167'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>September 18th.</span> Caro is back from New
York, and we leave a week from today. We
have decided to shave a few days off the limit
set by the Peon: if we don’t hurry, David
will have that house half finished before we
get there, and we want to see it go up from
the beginning ourselves. Besides, Caro wants
a little time with Milly. Her wedding is set
for the last of October, and Caro’s is to be
six weeks later. I’m afraid it will take strenuous
work to get Cousin Jane where we want
her by that time; but if we go home and start
on her at once, the thing may be done.</p>

<hr class='tbk168'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>September 24th.</span> The last day in the Garden!
The Mistress has been out, and I have
been trying, in rather a bungling way, to make
her understand what she has done for me.
Neither she nor the Madam can know the
whole of it, and I hope they never will; for
they would have to live in the same prison-house
to understand what a door of escape
means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eh, but the summer is over, and I count
my stay by hours!—Yes; but the summer will
never end. Even when the prison is lost sight
of, the door of escape will remain a delight.
The things that hurt pass, and are forgotten;
things not understood change and grow clear:
but joy does not change, not kindness, nor
anything that makes life worth while. And
so, good-bye to the Garden.</p>

<div><h1><a id='nest'></a>XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='sc'>While the Nest was Building</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>September 30th.</span> We reached home three
days ago, having forestalled the possibility of
orders not to come by concealing our plans
until we were on the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The house is no house at all yet, of course.
Caro calls it the Perchery at present, and
says she will give it a name when we can all
sit in it, instead of roosting on stones outside
and staring at the place where it is going to
be. But the cellar is finished, anyway, and
is of ample proportions, as a country cellar
should be; and until we get something else to
admire, we find it an absorbing subject of contemplation.
Even Cousin Jane was delighted
with it, and still more with Caro’s promise
to go home with her and stay until after the
wedding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro went over there as soon as I was settled
in bed for a rest, and came back glowing
with triumph. Cousin Jane was coming in
the morning to spend the day, and to take
the child back home with her in the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And oh, Mammy Lil, she’s perfectly
charmed with David, and quite certain she
picked him out for me! The shock of it nearly
bowled me over for a minute. You know that
big New York bank that failed a week or two
ago? Everybody thought Bob’s father’s bank
was mixed up in it, and there was a regular
run on it. David and Daddy Jack were too
full of the Perchery to mention it; but it converted
Cousin Jane straight through. The
bank’s all right—I asked David about it, driving
home—but you can’t make Cousin Jane
believe it. She thinks a bank should be above
suspicion by anybody, and if it isn’t, it’s a
whited sepulchre forevermore. So she’s delighted
that she had the good sense to pass
over a fellow like Bob, who comes from a
family of speculators, and choose for me a
good, steady, kind, reliable business man like
David Bird, instead. I wish you could hear
her, Mammy Lil; she’s downright edifying.
And she fairly beamed on David, though he
hadn’t been near her for weeks. Everything’s
all right, if only the hot weather doesn’t make
you sick. If they’d told us how hot it was,
I wouldn’t have brought you home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heat was extraordinary for the time
of the year, and still continues so; but it didn’t
keep Cousin Jane at home, though usually
she won’t budge unless it’s cool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in high good humor, and evidenced
it by a peck on my cheek and the remark that
I must be getting better, for I really didn’t
look so very many years older than I was.
She approved of the plans for the house, especially
when she found it was to be our
wedding gift to Caro; and she went out “to
perch,” at Caro’s invitation, and admired every
stone in the foundations. Then she came in
and settled seriously down to the subject of
clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems that Grace is lavishing on Milly’s
outfit all the pretty things Cousin Jason prevented
her from giving the child in her girlhood;
and Cousin Jane’s family pride has risen
in a most desirable and unexpected manner
to demand that Caro shall be as well provided
for as her cousin; so Caro can prepare in
peace. Cousin Jane even proposes to help
her, tooth and nail. Caro and I are a little
daunted by this excess of zeal, Cousin Jane’s
taste—or lack of it—being a byword in the
family. But Caro will find a way to manage
her; and we have already settled the question
of the dress she is to wear at the wedding. I
had Caro buy it for me in New York—a soft,
rich, silken fabric—and it is to be made by
the best dressmaker in the city. If we left it
to Cousin Jane, she would get old black Sally
to make it, at seventy-five cents a day; she says
it’s sinful to waste money on town dress-makers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she doesn’t mind my wasting it for her.
If there was a corner of her heart still congealed
it melted when she took the silk between
her finger and thumb, and fully tested
its quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an elegant present, Lyddy,” she declared
graciously, “an’ I don’t mind taking
it from you one mite. I’ve always said you
meant well; an’ it ain’t your fault if you’re
foolish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could I ask for a handsomer coat of white-wash
than that?</p>

<hr class='tbk169'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>October 2nd.</span> Last night was sticky, hot,
and still, with the stars flaming overhead, as
though they were trying to burn the heavens.
I fell asleep at last, to be wakened suddenly
by a sound as if the wind were ripping the sky
off the earth, and ten million tons of water were
sluicing through the hole. The world was all
one glare of light, with sudden, momentary
breaks of darkness, while a roar as of a thousand
batteries surged up from every quarter
of the heavens, and filled to bursting the
black void above our heads. I sprang up
to close the windows, my ankles brushed by
quick, ghostly touches, as loose papers skittered
over the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Peon and David came in, in hastily donned
attire, for the storm was altogether out of
the ordinary. The house trembled like a living
thing, and in the air about us we could feel the
crackle of the blinding light. Then came a
crash that split the earth. A moment later,
through the surging billows of water hurled
through the wind-rent air, we saw a sudden,
leaping light, red in the white electric glare.
A huddled company of straw-stacks had been
struck by the descending bolt, and not even
that flood of water could quench the flames.
The heavy clouds, weighted almost to earth,
caught the sullen glow beneath them, and as
they were flung onward and upward by the
screaming wind, carried the lurid colors of destruction
far into the blackness overhead. One
moment a world of blinding white, as the lightning
blotted out everything but its own wild
glare. The next, a red and lowering world, sullen,
portentous, with the evil color spreading,
climbing, licking out on all sides in an orgy of
ruin and waste whose greed defied the cataracts
of water, and made the wild wind its
minister and slave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The air rocked with the thunderous down-pour
under the crashing clouds. One of the
maples fell prone in the lightning’s glare;
and from every side came the sound of rending
wood as branches were wrenched and split and
hurled across the lawn. The house shook,
while around us and above us the Titans
fought. In the presence of that unveiled power
one’s own small life dwindled to nothingness.
One marveled that human feebleness yet held
a place in a world so charged with forces,
the least of which could wipe out all human
effort and leave the earth as bare as a new-sponged
slate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the fury passed. The Titans screamed
and fought, but their power waned. The wind
wavered and sank, sobbing like a beaten child;
the rain splashed dully, dripping from porches
and eaves; the thunder died on distant hills,
and the lightnings grew fitful and weak. Even
the storm-born flames were spent, until only
a hot coal of light glowed under the breaking
clouds. A star shone here and there, mirrored
in the rain-pools of the drenched fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David opened the windows, and we drank
in the freshness of the storm-cleansed air. The
new-washed leaves, still green with summer
time, whispered in the quietness, and here and
there a cricket chirped, or a night-bird called
to its mate. Power was veiled again, withdrawn;
and life that had trembled in the balance
resumed its wonted course.</p>

<hr class='tbk170'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>October 9th.</span> I asked Grace today about
Cousin Jason. I knew she was worrying over
something. Milly might be happy, but she
wasn’t. So I asked her how he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t speak to me, Lil, at all. I have
been there two or three times; but he wouldn’t
see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he coming to the wedding?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wrote to ask him that—to show him we
really wanted him; but he sent the letter back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes filled with unwonted tears, and I
had a sudden desire to jerk my jay-bird cousin’s
feathers out by the roots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll just have to train your thoughts to
keep away from him, Grace,” I said. “I know
you can, for I’ve steered my own clear of a lot
of things I simply don’t dare to fool with.
Don’t shake your head at me, madam! Do you
think Milly doesn’t see that look in your eyes
when you sit and think about Cousin Jason?
Are you going to let him hurt her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m not,” she said firmly. “I’ll make
my eyes behave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll have to make your thoughts
behave behind your eyes. You let Cousin Jason
alone. If you’ll quit paying attention to
him long enough, he’ll come round; but as long
as you give him a chance to rebuff you, he’ll
amuse himself doing it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I follow your advice or your example—you
door-mat for Cousin Jane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I laughed myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind. We can find out how to do
a thing perfectly, many a time, just by doing
it the way it shouldn’t be done. And I did
send Cousin Jane home once. I know the
recording angel put that down to my credit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We fell to talking of her plans. Milly and
her husband are to live with her, he going in to
his business daily, like the Peon. But Grace
wants them to have this first winter alone together.
So as soon as they get back from their
wedding trip, and Caro is married, she expects
to go away with George’s niece, and
spend the winter travelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Peon and I will stay at Bird Corners.
The children will be gone for five or six weeks,
and by the time they come home the Perchery
will almost be ready for them to begin
feathering their nest—And to think it’s the
real Bird Corners, and not Make-Believe at
all!</p>

<hr class='tbk171'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>October 16th.</span> The young mocking-birds are
learning to sing, and their efforts are altogether
charming. They sit apart, crooning,
each to himself, trying their score over and
over, thoughtfully, with pauses in which they
seem to search their memories for forgotten
notes. It is as if melody had come with them
from the land of dreams, and they were trying
to catch and hold the elusive sweetness, and
teach it to come at their command. The soft,
dreamy music floats through the October sunshine,
at once a memory and a hope. It is a
song of the garnered years, an inheritance
from old days of love and aspiration, and it
presages days of love and aspiration yet to be.
But more than both of these, it voices the peace
of autumn days, when the earth has finished the
long year’s toil, and turns to its hard-won rest
in the quiet of the misty sunshine.</p>

<hr class='tbk172'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>October 20th.</span> I don’t need my note-book
these days. When one can do so much living
with people the birds are no longer a necessity.
I hear their songs and calls, and know them
for the voices of my friends—real friends for
life. But Caro comes over nearly every day,
and always there is so much to talk about.
And often Cousin Jane comes too; and it’s
positively exhilarating to see the way Caro and
I are corrupting her morals. That old lady is
getting as worldly-minded as if there were not
a blackbird saint in existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dressmaker made her get a modern
corset to be fitted in, and she’s so pleased
with herself in it that she wears it all the time.
She really looks like another person, for Caro
has coaxed her into curl-papers o’ nights, and
the soft gray fluff around her face is amazingly
different from the wide part with the flat
straight bands plastered over her temples and
ears. The old Buff Orpington doesn’t know
her any more, and Caro says he shrieks and
runs at the sight of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody in Chatterton notices the change,
and tells her she looks years younger—as she
does; and the other evening Cousin Chad took
up the tale, and grew positively sentimental,
right before Caro. Cousin Jane blushed and
bridled as she must have done over forty years
ago, and next day she bought the prettiest
stuff for a house dress, and carried it to the
wedding-gown dressmaker to make! She says
it’s every woman’s Christian duty to be attractive
in her own home, and that if Chadwell
will be a boy and like frippery, she’ll have to
give in to him; the Lord didn’t give men much
sense anyway, and you just have to humor
them along, like children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I feel rather ashamed of myself, I must
confess. I’ve been laughing at her all these
years, like all the rest of the family, and been
cross with her inside, often. And what she
needed most was for somebody to see the simple
human need for praise and petting under
all her strident aggressiveness; for as soon as
she got it she blossomed out like this! I said
as much to Caro today, and she cocked her
head suddenly to one side as if she heard someone
calling her. Then she jumped up, laughing,
spun around on one toe, and caught me in
her arms. She said I’d given her such a big
idea I’d taken her breath away. She wouldn’t
tell me what it was, but ran off to the buggy
and drove singing down to the gate.</p>

<hr class='tbk173'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>October 24th.</span> Caro has given me the shock
of my life. I’ve seen she had some kind of bee
in her bonnet for three or four days, but she
was bent on being mysterious, so I didn’t
tease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yesterday, as I sat on the side porch, whipping
lace, I saw her buggy coming out from
between the cedars, and Cousin Jason was in
it! Caro was beaming, as usual, and Cousin
Jason looked as if he were having a good time,
and embarrassed to know what to do with it.
I went to meet them as they drove toward the
Perchery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He greeted me awkwardly, and explained
that Caro wanted him to see her house, and
that he’d had no more sense than to give in to
her and come. Caro dashed at him at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean you had sense enough to come,”
she corrected. “Cousin Jason really has lots
of sense, Mammy Lil, only he thought it was
nonsense and tried his best to hide it. We’re
going up to town together tomorrow on a
lark—just we two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t promised yet,” he growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t promise,” said Caro sweetly.
“I told you it wasn’t necessary. All you need
to do is to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made him admire the house and the
plans; and when he objected to her numerous
closets she assured him that his ideas were all
wrong, and that the lack of closets in his own
house was the root of most of his troubles; he
needed them to pack his skeletons in, instead of
entertaining them in public. They went off
together presently; but Caro promised to come
back this evening and spend the night. I knew
I should have the tale then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came, and the three of us had dinner
together, the Peon being in town. And now
that she and David are at the piano in the next
room, I must finish the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went straight from here the other day
to Cousin Jason’s, and told him she wanted
him to come to Milly’s wedding and give the
bride away. He was too amazed to be angry
at first; and when he did get angry, Caro stood
her ground, kept her temper, and gave him
what she called a preachment—a mixture of
fun, coaxing, and straight-from-the-shoulder
talking. She made no impression, apparently,
so when she was ready to go she left, assuring
him cheerfully that she would be back in the
morning and take the matter up with him
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had always liked Caro, and her sheer audacity
pleased him. She took her work the next
morning and spent the day. When Cousin Jason
grew weary of argument, he went out on
the farm; but Caro was there when he came
back. She had carried over various good things
to eat, and gave him a lunch such as he hadn’t
enjoyed since he left Grace’s. She argued,
coaxed, ridiculed, and scolded. And by the time
David, who was sworn to secrecy, came by to
take her driving, Cousin Jason had promised
to think the matter over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I don’t believe it was what the child said
that impressed his stubborn nature; he simply
found Caro herself irresistible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she left him that day, his anger with
Grace, she said, was really a crumbling ruin;
but he didn’t realize it; so she went back next
morning to topple it to its fall. By the middle
of the afternoon he had said that if he could
be convinced Grace really wanted him, he
would go. Caro immediately challenged him to
go there with her to dinner that night, take
Grace by surprise, and see for himself. When
he refused she taunted him with backing out of
his own test, and dared him to the scratch.
She telephoned Grace finally that she wanted
to bring a friend to dinner, and they drove
over together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milly and Bobolink were out in his car,”
she said; “and Cousin Grace didn’t see us
coming. We walked right in on her in the
living-room before she knew he was there.”
Caro paused to wipe her eyes. “I’ll cry for
six months whenever I think about it. I don’t
see how Cousin Grace can care so much—he’s
been so hateful to her. I thought she was going
to faint at first. Then she stood there speechless,
her hands stretched out, and her face the
most beautiful thing I ever saw. He called
her name and went toward her, and she just
slipped into his arms with one long sob, as if
her heart were breaking. And I went out and
shut the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Milly came in she was plainly overjoyed,
for her mother’s sake, if not for his;
and Bobolink, Caro declared, behaved like an
archangel. She inconsistently elucidated this
remark by explaining that he had been brought
up on a farm and was as crazy about the
country as I am myself; and he has always
kept up his knowledge of agriculture and his
interest in it. Cousin Jason, who had taken
him for what he politely terms a city fool,
thawed visibly toward him during the evening.
And before he left he had promised to give the
bride away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro, who believes in striking while the iron
is hot, offered to go to town with him the next
day to order his dress-suit for the occasion. As
the wedding is to be on the twenty-ninth,
there is certainly no time to lose. But Cousin
Jason, who has scorned conventionality all his
life, balked instantly, and declared that if he
had to make a fool of himself to do it he
wouldn’t come to the wedding at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace agreed at once to his wearing anything
he chose; but Caro was resolved to carry
her point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, Mammy Lil, he was just in retreat,
and I had to rout him. If I had let
him make a stand about the clothes he’d wear
I’d have been throwing away my victory. So
I told him he had to have a dress-suit. He’d
need it for my wedding as well as Milly’s. I
didn’t tell him before Cousin Grace; I waited
till he drove me back to Cousin Jane’s. And
next day I went over again to sit up with him
about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ought to have admired your persistence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I told him. He began
to weaken a little, so I brought him over and
showed him the Perchery as a reward. And he
went this very day. The tailor said he couldn’t
make it in time, and Cousin Jason crowed and
said he’d told me so. But I explained to the
tailor that he could make it, and that he had
it to do. So he agreed. We bought gloves,
and a tie, and everything; and I made him get
his hair cut, and he’s going to look scrumptious.
You really haven’t an idea what can be
done with an old relation till you begin to furbish
him up.”</p>

<hr class='tbk174'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>October 30th.</span> Milly was married in church,
and she and Cousin Jason and Grace stopped
by here on their way to the wedding for me to
see them. Milly was beautiful, and no bride
but Caro could be sweeter; and Grace, all in
silvery gray, with that deep light in her eyes,
was like nothing but the Moonlight Sonata.
As to Cousin Jason, he was furbished
almost past recognition; and my admiration
pleased him like a boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caro fluttered about them, radiant in her
bridesmaid’s dress, and followed by David’s
adoring eyes. The Peon escorted Grace; and
after awhile I watched the carriages coming
back. Before they left for the station Caro
telephoned me, and Uncle Milton wheeled me
down to the gate, where I waved my handkerchief
and cast my handful of rice as they drove
by, Milly’s exquisite face alight with a look
her husband may well carry in his heart always.</p>

<hr class='tbk175'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>November 29th.</span> How fast the days slip
by! Milly came home early in the week, and
yesterday was the Thanksgiving I prophesied
about to David last spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly I am going all about the house;
and to emphasize my success as a seer we had
a family gathering at Thanksgiving dinner.
The bride and groom were here, of course, and
Grace, who leaves as soon as Caro is married,
and Cousin Jason—resplendent, by the way,
in his dress-suit, which he considered a capital
joke on Caro. Cousin Jane looked not a day
over fifty, and Cousin Chad had done some
furbishing himself to keep her company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To think of a dinner party at Bird Corners
again, after all these years! The Peon and I
beamed at one another from the ends of the
table; and in the centre, the bride and groom
faced the bride-and-groom-to-be, with the
older people tucked in at the corners. And
it was all so good to see and hear—such a fairy
tale come true—that, as I lie here today resting,
I am just too happy for words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>David and Caro are to be married next
Wednesday—married here, at Bird Corners.
I dare not risk going to the church yet, and
Cousin Jane’s is quite as far away. Besides,
both the children want it here, and it is and
always has been Caro’s home as well as David’s.
Cousin Jane has really been sweet
about it; and it is all settled that she and Caro
are to come over in time for me to help dress
the bride. Grace is coming tomorrow, and will
stay with me until it is all over and she goes
away herself.</p>

<hr class='tbk176'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>December 9th.</span> The wedding day was perfect—cloudless
blue, and the little red wren
singing his matins in the lilac almost before it
was light. I am glad the child is a winter
bride. She can afford to ignore the seasons,
for she carries spring-time in her heart, like
her namesake out of doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all beautiful, and I with my own
hands helped to make it so. But nothing
about it is very clear to me except the look
in the children’s eyes—<span class='it'>our</span> children, both of
them, at last. Caro’s joy had sobered her, so
that she walked the earth in radiance, instead
of fluttering, light-winged, above it; but David’s
joy had set him on the heights. Oh, my
son, my son, child of my soul always! I could
not have borne the look upon his face if I had
not known Caro through and through. But
now I am not afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace went the day after the wedding, and
left me in a world where real and Make-Believe
are blended into one. The Peon comes
home early, and together we walk across the
grass to the Perchery, and talk of how he
wheeled me there in those sorrowful days last
spring, when it seemed the knoll would never
know the nest we longed to see there. And in
the evening we sit in the firelight together, and
hear the childish voices of long ago in the room,
and childish feet in the hall. And we laugh
over the good old days, and smile over the new
days, which are better. And before I go to
bed we go to the window and look at the children’s
house, standing clear against the stars.
And they come and stand beside us there, their
tiny hands in ours—the dear, long-ago little
children, who will be with us always, though
the big children, dearer still, come and go
across the grass between their home and ours.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
